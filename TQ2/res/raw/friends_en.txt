A hump and a hairpiece?Phoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?[The others stare, bemused]Phoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!Monica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.Chandler: Sounds like a date to me.***Chandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked.All: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.Chandler: Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there.Joey: Instead of...?Chandler: That's right.Joey: Never had that dream.Phoebe: No.Chandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I dont know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.Monica: They weren't looking at you before?Chandler: Finally, I figure I better answer it. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because- she never calls me!***Ross: [Enters, mortified] Hi.Joey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.Monica: Are you okay, sweetie?Ross: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...Chandler: Cookie?Monica: [Explaining to others] Carol moved her stuff out today. [To Ross] Let me get you some coffee.***Ross: Oh no, no. Don't! Stop cleansing my aura.Phoebe: But...Ross: No. Just leave my aura alone, okay?Phoebe: Fine... be murky.Ross: I'll be fine. Really, you guys, I hope she'll be very happy.Monica: No, you don't.Ross: No, I don't! To hell with her! She left me!Joey: And you never knew she was a lesbian?Ross: No! Okay? Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know. How should I know?Chandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian. [everyone looks at him] Did I say that out loud?***Joey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?[Ross gestures his consent]Joey: Strip joints! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!***Ross: See, but I don't want to be single, okay? I just— I just— I just want to be married again.[Rachel in a wedding dress enters the shop]Chandler: And I just want a million dollars!.***Monica: Rachel?!Rachel: Oh, Monica, hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!Waitress: Can I get you some coffee?Monica: [Pointing at Rachel] De-caff. [To the gang] Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. [To Rachel] This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?Rachel: Hi, sure!Ross: Hi.[They go to hug but Ross' umbrella opens. he sits, defeated again][A moment of silence where Rachel sits; the others expect her to explain]Monica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?Rachel: Oh... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- [to waitress]Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew he looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. [To Monica] So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.Monica: -who wasn't invited to the wedding.Rachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...***Chandler and Joey: [To Phoebe] Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?Phoebe: Oh... I wish I could, but I don't want to.***Rachel: [Excited] Guess what?Ross: You got a job?Rachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.Chandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.Rachel: Well, you would be too if you found Joan and David boots on sale, fifty percent off.Chandler: Oh, how well you know me.***Chandler: I think, for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.Ross: Yeah, and — and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that — that... that's not... why we bought the ticket.Chandler: You see, the problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again. Y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically, just trying to stay awake.Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.Joey: Are we still talking about sex?***Rachel: You're a twin?Phoebe: Oh, yeah. We don't speak. She's, like, this...high-powered, driven, career type.Chandler: What does she do?Phoebe: She's a waitress.***Ross: [talking about the baby's name] Wait a minute, why is Susan's name in it?Susan: It's my baby, too.Ross:Funny, I don't remember you making any sperm!***Phoebe: There's five hundred extra dollars in my account.Chandler: Oh! Satan's minions at work again.Phoebe: Yes, coz I have to go down there and deal with them.Joey: What are you talking about? Keep it!Phoebe: It's not mine! I didn't earn it. If I kept it, it would be like stealing!Rachel: Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!***[Phoebe finds something in her can of soda.]Ross: A thumb?Joey: Ewwww!Phoebe: I know, I know. I opened it up, and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker.Chandler: Maybe it's a contest, you know, like, "collect all five."***Monica: Hey Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?Joey: Probably kill myself.Monica: Excuse me?Joey: Hey, if little Joey's dead, then I've got no reason to live.Ross: Joey, omnipotent.Joey: You are? I'm so sorry.***[Rachel opens her first paycheck.]Rachel: Isn't this exciting! I earned this! I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally... not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money?***Rachel: Phoebe?Phoebe: Hmm?Rachel: Who is George Snuffleupagus?Phoebe: He's Big Bird's friend. [laughs]***Ross: It's amazing, okay? You just reach in there, there's just one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right? As far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?Rachel: Come on! You guys can pee standing up.Chandler: We can? All right, I'm trying that.Joey: You know what blows my mind? Women can see breast whenever they want, you just look down and they are there! How you get any work done is beyond me.Phoebe: You know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things and, like, not even care.[Long Pause]Ross: ... Multiple Orgasms!***[Chandler and Phoebe both get ready to break up with their significant others.]Phoebe: This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.Chandler: It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.***[Ross draws his laundry detergent]Rachel: What is that?Ross: Uberweiss! It's new, it's German, it's Extra tough***[The gang watches Joey's performance in Freud!, a local musical.]Joey: [in a German accent]Well, Eva, we've doon some excellent work here, and I would have to say, your problem is qviiite clear.[singing]All you want is a dinkle,What you envy's a schwang,A thing through which you can tinkle,Or play with, or simply let hang!***Monica: What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?Joey: I couldn't do it.Monica: Good for you, Joey.Joey: When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is.***Phoebe: [singing]New York City has no powerAnd the milk is getting sour :: But to me it is not scary'Cause I stay away from dairy.***Chandler: You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.Jill Goodacre: [gives him a strange look and a stick of gum]Chandler: [thinking] Gum would be perfection. Gum would be perfection. I could have said gum would be nice, could have said I'll have a stick. But no no no no no, for me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself.***Chandler: [after being told by everyone he makes a gay first impression even though he said "be vague about it"] So... what is it about me?Monica: I don't know....You...you have a quality.Everyone: Yeah. Absolutely. A quality.Chandler: Oh, oh, a quality! Good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this.***Chandler: What is it about me? Is it my hair?Rachel: Yes, it's exactly that, Chandler. It's your hair.Phoebe: You have homosexual hair.***[Ross' grandmother woke up from being "dead" and then died.]Mr. Geller: She may have died.Aunt Lillian: She may have died?Mr. Geller: We're looking into it.***Ross: Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about being a lesbian.Susan: Yeah, you know, you have to take a course, otherwise they don't let you do it.***Ross: [talks to his unborn baby] And everyone's telling me, "You gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major." So on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills any more!***Monica: [complaining about her Thanksgiving] Did anyone ever give a hoot about what I wanted? NO, NO, NO, NO! And I'm just... [her voice gets very squeaky and high-pitched]Chandler: Okay, Monica, only dogs can hear you now.***Chandler: Do either of you have the keys?Monica: The oven is on!Rachel: Oh, I've got to get my ticket!Joey: Wait, wait, we have a copy of your keys.Monica: Well then, get it, get it!Joey: Hey, hey, that tone won't make me go any faster.Monica: Joey.Joey: That one will.***Phoebe [singing]:I made a man with eyes of coal and a smile so bewitchin'How was I supposed to know that my mom was dead in the kitchen?La lalala laaa la lala La lalala la la...My mother's ashes, even her eyelashes, are resting in a little yellow jar.And sometimes, when it's breezy, I feel a little sneezy...***Rachel: So I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you.Phoebe: Yeah, you wish.***[Rachel hands out copies of her steamy romance novel draft to the gang.]Rachel: Oh, and — and on page 2, he's not reaching for her heaving beasts.Monica: What's a niffle?Joey: You can usually find them on the heaving beasts.Rachel: All right, all right, all right.

I tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!Phoebe: I just got to the part about "her public hair."***Chandler: What are you guys doing out here?Ross: Uh... uh... Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept.Joey: Yeah, well, you don't have your racket.Ross: No, no I don't, because it's being restrung. Somebody was supposed to bring me one.Joey: Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size.Chandler: Okay, you guys spend way too much time together.***[Chandler is setting the record straight with his mother and Joey's listening inJoey: [to Ross] ... and then he said, "When are you gonna start acting like my mom?" then she said "When are yougonna realize I have a bomb?"Ross: Are you sure she didn't say "When are you gonna realize I am your mom?Joey: Oh... That makes more sense.***Joey: Ross, did you really read all these baby books?Ross: Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like [snaps fingers] that.***Ross: Wasn't it supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?***[Monica has just beaten Joey and Chandler at foosball with just herself playing for the "who-knows?" how many times]Monica: [happy] And that would be a shut-down!Joey and Chandler: [in unison] SHUT-OUT!!***[Rachel is holding a weave over her breasts and yelling at Chandler for coming in with no announcement]Chandler: [interrupting] Rachel, can I just say something?Rachel: WHAT?!Chandler: That's a loose weave.

It wasn't like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of doughnuts!***Ross: All right, all right. We're all adults here. There's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your peepee.Chandler: You know, I don't see that happening.Rachel: C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat.Chandler: Well, I'm not showing you my tat.***Rachel: You are supposed to be in there so i can see your thing.Chandler: Sorry. My-my thing was in there with me.***Chandler: Oh, man. In my next life I'm coming back as a toilet brush!***Janice: I brought you something.Chandler: Is it loaded?***Chandler: [Preparing to break up with Janice for the third time] There's no easy way to say this. At least, there's no new way for me to say this.***Chandler: Can you see my nipples through this shirt?Rachel: No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there.***Ross: Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?Joey: How about Tony's?

I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know... Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking. Even though I did it, later that same day. But to my parents, by then it was like, "Yeah, right, so what else is new?"***[At the Lamaze class, mother-to-be Carol panics after seeing a videotaped birth.]Ross: Everything's going to be all right.Carol: What do you know?!

Monica turns to him]:Monica: You are dead meat.Chandler: I didn't know it was a big secret.Monica: [smiles] Oh, it's not big. Not at all.

It's what's underneath the sweater that counts.***Phoebe: You guys, do you know anything about chicks?Chandler: Fowl? No. Women?... No.***[Chandler walks in on Ross and Rachel]Chandler: Not to be rude, but does anyone know how to get a chick out of a VCR?***[Chandler is putting the duck in the hall]Chandler: Now you just stay out here, and think about what you did!***[A bedraggled Phoebe misses Joey's play, having spent all night on the phone while kept on hold by customer service.]Joey: Hey, Pheebs — where were ya?Phoebe: I'm so, so sorry, Joey.

Well, he'd prefer watercolors — but, you know, he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.***Ross: [Watching the fight on TV where Pete gets injured and talking to Monica] This is ironic. Out of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it now Pete can't!***[Monica has just broken up with Pete in the hospital and is walking out]Pete: Wait. [Monica pauses] Could you leave a note? They've got me on a lot of pills, and I'm not sure I'll remember this tommorrow.***Rachel: I broke up with you because I was mad at you, not because I stopped loving you.Ross: You still love me?Rachel: ...No.***Chandler: [referring to Rachel's oversized sombrero hat] Wait a minute, I know that hat.

She goes on for five pages about how I was "unfaithful" to her! WE WERE ON A BREAK!Chandler: If you say that one more time, I'm going to break up with you!Ross: Fine! But this breakup was not all my fault. And at then she goes, "If you accept full responsibility-full responsibility-I can begin to trust you again. Does that sound like something you can do? Does it?Joey: No...Chandler: Look, you have what you want, you're back with Rachel! If you bring this up, you'll wreck the best thing that's ever happened to you.Ross: You're right... Okay, I'll let it go. But you realize how hard it is to forget about it!Joey: Sure it's hard! But that doesn't mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that beach trip that we should [turns to Chandler] never EVER talk about!Ross: What the hell happened on that beach?!Joey: It's between us and the sea, Ross!***Ross: And for the record, it took two people to break this relationship!Rachel: Yeah! You and that girl from the copy place, which yesterday you took full responsibility for!Ross: I didn't know what I was taking responsibility for! I didn't finish the letter!Rachel: What?Ross: I fell asleep!Rachel: You fell a-SLEEP?!Ross: It was five-thirty in the morning! And you had rambled on for eighteen pages! Front and back! [leaves the room, then turns around] And by the way, y-o-u-apostrophe-r-e is "you are". Y-o-u-r is "your"!Rachel: I can't believe I even thought of getting back together with you! We are soooo over!Ross: [fakes beginning of sniveling and interrupts it saying...] FINE BY ME!Rachel: And those little spelling tips will come in handy when you're home on Saturday nights playing scrabble with Monica!Monica: Hey!Rachel: Sorry! But I feel bad about all that sleep you'll miss wishing you were with me!Ross: Oh, no, don't worry about me "falling asleep." I still have your letter! [walks out]Rachel: And, hey, just so you know — it's not that common, it doesn't happen to every guy, and it is a big deal! [slams door, revealing Chandler behind it]Chandler: I knew it!***Monica: DAMN ALL THE JELLYFISH!***Rachel: Wow, they really got you guys, your T.V., the chairs...Phoebe: Yeah. Your microwave, the stereo...Joey: Aw, man!

I brought you back a macaroon!Joanna: Oh, great! I'll keep it in my butt with your nose.***Joey: Please don't kick Monica and Rachel out! This wasn't their fault, it was mine.Mr. Treeger: You want me to kick you guys out instead?Joey: No, you can't do that. Where would the chick and the duck live?Mr. Treeger: You have pets?Joey: No-no-no-no, those are nicknames. I'm the chick and Chandler is the duck.Mr. Treeger: Huh... I would've thought it was the other way around.***Mr. Treeger: Hey, Duck. Is Chick home?Chandler: Uhh...Joey: I'm comin.'Mr. Treeger: Okay. [to Chandler] Thanks, man.Chandler: No problem... bunny... rabbit.***Phoebe: Before I start, I just wanna say that I have a cold, so if I sneeze in the middle of a song, it's not on purpose. Oh, except the last verse of "Pepper people."***Joey: What the hell was that?Chandler: What?Joey: Kathy was being nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.Chandler: What do you want from me?Joey: I want you to like her! But if that's too damn difficult for you, then the least you could do is pretend!Chandler: I AM pretending.Joey: Well, then do it better.Chandler: Okay, uh, what do you say I go over there and tell her how much I like her? [Joey gives Chandler a thumbs-up.] No, no, it'll be good. I can tell her how much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment we met. That I'm so fantastically over-the-top want-to-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!Joey: Well, that's pretty good, but you wanna tone it down a little.***Rachel: You know what else is really great about him? Oh, what is the word for an adult who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?Ross: Oh... [knocks his fists together at Rachel]Rachel: What was that?Ross: Monica knows.Monica: It's this dumb thing that Ross made up just to try to fool our parents. It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it. [to Ross] I remember I cried the night you made that up. It was the first time I realized I was cooler than my big brother.Ross: Well, I'm gonna go get ready... [knocks his fists at Monica]***[Ross and Cheryl are at her apartment.]Cheryl: Would you like to come in?Ross: Did homo erectus hunt with wooden tools?Cheryl: According to recent findings!***Joey: Her place was really that bad?Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day? Well, like that — only, instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time and garbage is all that has survived!***Chandler: Look, I just think it's time for you to settle down, you know? Make a choice, pick a lane!Joey: Who's Elaine?***Joey: And what? Did you sleep with her?Chandler: No! No, I just kissed her.Joey: What?! That's even worse!Chandler: ...How is that worse?!Joey: I don't know, but it's the same!Chandler: Look, Joey, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help myself. I think I'm in love with her.Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back? I would never do that to you!Chandler: You’re right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.Joey: Over the line? You — you’re — you’re so far past the line, that you — you can’t even see the line! The line is a dot to you!***Monica: How cute is the on-call doctor?Rachel: So cute I'm thinking of jabbing this pen in my eye.***Phoebe: Yeah, but, Monica — do you really want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase "That's not how your dad used to do it"?Monica: [indicating each of the group in succession] Fine! Judge all you want to, but: [to Ross] married a lesbian; [to Rachel] left a man at the altar; [to Phoebe] fell in love with a gay ice dancer; [to Joey] threw a girl’s wooden leg in a fire; [to Chandler] living in a box!***Ross: Didn't you read Lord of the Rings in high school?Joey: No, I had sex in high school.***Rachel: No 'accountants'.

Oh. Yep.Chandler: [points] That's one?Monica: Kind of an important one.Chandler: Oh, you know what? I was looking at it upside down.Rachel: Well, you know, sometimes that helps. [Chandler gapes.]Monica: All right. Now most guys will hit one, two, three and then go to seven and set up camp.Chandler: And that's bad?Rachel: Well, if you go to Disneyland, you don't spend the whole day on the Matterhorn.Chandler: Well, you might, if it were anything like seven.Monica: All right. Uh, the important thing is to take your time. You want to hit them all and you want to mix them up. Keep them on their toes.Rachel: Oooooo, toes! [Chandler stares.] For some people!Monica: All right. You could start out with a little one, a two, a one two three, a three, a five, a four, a three two, two, a two four six, a two four six, four, two, two, four seven, five seven, six seven, [starts shouting] seven. Seven seven SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN SEVEN [leans back in ecstasy with eyes closed and holds up the number seven]... And there you are.Rachel: Yeah, that'll work.[They stand up awkwardly.

That, my friends, is my New Year's resolution.Phoebe: Ohh... that's a good one. Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.Chandler: That's a good one too, Pheebs.

NOW GET OUT HERE!Chandler: Well, we had a great run. What was it — four, five months? That's more that most people have in a lifetime. So bye, take care, buh-bye then. [kisses Monica and gets ready to jump out the window]***Monica: Do you really think the best reason to get married is because you're sorry?Chandler: Well, no, the best reason to get married is pregnancy. Sorry's about fourth, behind being ready and actually wanting to get married.***Rachel: I brought reinforcements.Ross: You brought Joey?Rachel: Um... no, but I brought the next best thing.[Chandler walks in.]Chandler: Hey.Ross: Chandler? You brought Chandler? The next best thing would have been Monica!Chandler: Normally I'd be offended, but she is freakishly strong.***Ross: Look, I drew a sketch about how we're gonna do it.

So?Monica: So we've gotta go upstairs and have a lot of sex and prove them wrong.Chandler: Honey, you've got to stop this competitive thing. Just to beat some other couple you want me to go upstairs and have sex with you over and over and over and... I'm saying no to this why? Get your coat!***Chandler: You smoked.Rachel: I did not.Chandler: Yes you did. You look happy and sick-- you smoked!Rachel: All right, fine, but I had to. I had to do it for my career.Chandler: I wish I had to smoke for my career.***Joey: Hi, Ben. So you want to be an actor, huh? Well, I go to tell you, it's no picnic. There's ton of rejection. No stability. I mean, one day you're Dr. Drake Ramoray. The next day you're eating ketchup right out of the bottle. It's a tough life. I mean, sure, okay you can get up whenever you want, watch T.V. all day, meet tons of women in acting class... Who am I kidding? I can't talk you out of this. It's a great life.***Chandler: Rachel, did it bother you when Ross flirted with other women?Rachel: No, it bothered me when he slept with other women.***Rachel: Ross! We broke up two years ago.

Half of the taste is in the smell! You're sucking up all the taste units!Chandler: Okay, I'll give them back [exhales].***Monica: Man, I would be great in a war! I really think I'd make a fantastic military leader. I mean, I know I'd make general before any of you guys.Chandler: Before or after you were shot by your own troops?***Phoebe: Well, you all know that I am a pacifist, which means I am not interested in war - in any way. But when the revolution comes I will have to destroy you all; not you, Joey.***Joey: So is Staten Island really an island?Ross: Hence the name: Staten Island.Joey: Oh, I thought it was like Long Island.Ross: Also an island!***[Ross and Joey talk during a game of catch.]Ross: They found a Paleozoic amphibian in the jaws of a Mesozoic mastodon! How did it get there?Joey: Maybe this should be more of a quiet game.***[Rachel comes in with a cat.]Rachel: check it out!Ross: what... what is that?Joey: what the hell is that?Rachel: it's a catJoey: that is not at catRachel: yes, it isRoss: why is it inside out?***Joey: Who would you rather sleep with: Monica or Rachel?Ross: Dude, you are sick.Joey: Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had that whole Rachel thing.***Phoebe: [about which route to take to Vegas] Oh, if you take the northern route, there's a man in Illinois with a beard of bees.Joey: Great!

But I ran into Richard.Phoebe: Which Richard?Monica: The Richard.Phoebe: Richard Simmons?!Monica: No, my ex-boyfriend Richard. You know: the tall guy, mustache.Phoebe: Okay, that actually makes more sense. How was it?***Rachel: No! Phoebe, just because I'm alone doesn’t mean I wanna walk around naked. I mean, you live alone, you don't walk around naked.Phoebe: Uh-huh! Why do you think it takes me so long to answer the door?***Joey: [To Rachel] Hey Rach, how you doin'?Rachel: [grins] I'm doing good, baby. How you doin'?Joey: Ross, don't let her drink any more!***Ross: Wanna hear something weird?Phoebe: Always!Ross: Rachel and me are still married.Phoebe: What?Ross: I didn't get the annulment. We're still married. Don't tell Rachel. Okay, see you later...***Ross: I just don't want my tombstone to read, "Ross Geller: Three divorces."Phoebe: Don't feel worried about that! Your tombstone can say whatever you want it to say! It could say, "Ross Geller: Good at Marriage!" Y'know? Mine's going to say "Phoebe Buffay: Buried Alive."***Ross: We were drunk! I would've married Joey with that amount of alcohol!Phoebe: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!***Joey: Yeah, why don't you move in with me? It'll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies. And you know about Naked Thursdays, right?Rachel: Yeah, yeah. I think I'm gonna find my own place.Chandler: Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdays was just our thing, man!***Phoebe: Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones come out the top of her head! That's why women are shorter, so that men will fall in love when they hug them!

Well, that makes sense since you’re gay and addicted to heroin...***Joey: Why isn't that valet back with my Porsche?Passer-by: Maybe because you've got the keys?***Chandler: Here is the phone bill.Joey: Oh, my...!!Chandler: That's our phone number.***Rachel: You know what else I'm not gonna miss? [mockingly] "I'm Monica. I wash the toilet seventeen times a day, even if people are on it!"Monica: "Hi, I'm Rachel. Is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, I better wash it and shrink it!"Rachel: "I'm Monica. I don't get phone messages from interesting people, ever.Phoebe: Hey, I call her.Monica: "Oh my, I love Ross, I hate Ross!

You know, I run like I did when I was a kid because that's the only way it's fun. You know? I mean, didn't you even run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? You know, like when you were running towards the swings, or running away from Satan?[Rachel looks confused.]Phoebe: The neighbor's dog.***Monica: Honey, that's a great idea nailing your boxes to the floor !Chandler: I didn't nail my boxes to the floor.Monica: Oh so you can move them !***Chandler: [offering Joey a game of Playstation] Hi, my name's Chandler! I just moved in next door, and I was wondering if you'd be interested in battling me in a post-apocalyptic world for control of the galaxy's last remaining energy source.Joey: Sure.***Rachel:[Referring to her boss Kim] She doesn't like me very much.Chandler: That's great. Because my boss doesn't like me either.Monica: My boss doesn't like me either.Ross: Maybe it's like a universal thing.Joey: Or maybe because you're all hanging around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.All others: [In chorus] Let's get off to work...***Joey: You're gonna cook something?Rachel: Hey, I cook!Chandler: Offering people gum is not cooking.***[On tasting Rachel's English trifle/Shepherd's pie]Ross: It tastes like feet!Joey: I like it!Ross: Are you serious?Joey: What's not to like? Custard, good. Jam, good. Beef, GOOD!***Ross: And that's the story of the dreidel. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolizing life's triumph over death. And that was, like, four thousand years ago.Rachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.***Rachel: That's a great story, grandpa!***Phoebe: [to Ross] You bought your sheets at a flea market? Come on, Ross, you gotta loosen the pursestrings a little!***Rachel: OK, fine! I’ll just tell Phoebe it’s an antique apothecary table, she doesn’t have to know where it came from. Oh, look at this! Little drawers!

I mean... you — you are going to die, but you're not gonna die today... I wish I was dead.***Chandler [imitating Roger]: "Here's some little-known facts about couscous: they didn't add the second cous until 1979."***Ross: Sorry your husband cheated on you.Rachel: And I'm sorry your wife is gay. I guess women ain't that great either, huh?Ross: Try telling my wife that.***Phoebe: [singing]: It only takes two heart attacks to finally make you see,One of them won 't do it but the second will set you free.

Why?Phoebe: You guys were right, Parker's too excited about everything. I mean I'm all for living, but come on, this is the Geller's 35th wedding anniversary, let's call a spade a spade, this party stinks!Joey: I know, I'm having the worst time. There was a 15-minute line for the buffet, then when I finally got up to the plates, I slipped on a giant booger!Phoebe: Really? Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?Joey: I dunno, I guess it could've been. I didn't really look at it. I just wiped it on Chandler's coat and got the hell outta there.***Chandler:[About Parker] Somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man.***Parker: My God, I don't want to forget this moment! It's like I want to take a mental picture of you all. Click!Chandler: I don't think the flash went off.***Parker: Is something wrong?Phoebe: Wrong? Really, you know the word wrong?

Oh, my, he's gone!Phoebe: "Oh, I have to get my number back. Oh, my, he's gone." Dead on.***Monica: Chandler, you have to tell Joey that you're not in Tulsa.Chandler: Don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating on me than for him to think that I'm cheating on him? [Monica looks at him strangely] I heard it!***Phoebe: And I heard him say, as he flew out of sight, "Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!"Joey: Wow, you really wrote that?Phoebe: Uh-huh.***Monica: Wendy's a fat girls name.Phoebe: Are we still on that?Monica: No, you're right. Let's talk about something else. Let's talk about snow. Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa, where my husband's having sex on a copying machine?***[Chandler is practicing advertising slogans.]Chandler: How hard can it be, right? "Cheese. It's milk that you chew." "Crackers. Because your cheese needs a buddy." "A grape. Because who can get a water melon in your mouth?"Monica: I got one. "Socks. Because your family's feet deserve the best."Chandler: Honey? Leave it to the pros.***Chandler: Phones: bringing you closer to people...who have phones.Monica: "Marriage. It's not for everybody."***Mike: Hey, when did we become one of those couple who let our rat babies control our lives?***Ross: Ya, ho.. ya. OK, sure, look, can we, can we talk about what happened here last night?Chandler: Sure, just gimme a second to get all huffy and weird like you. *harrumphing* Do you believe that whoever did something over here last night did what they did or didn't do, I mean come on!***Chandler: Today is the 6th.Monica: No. [Shows Chandler a calendar]Chandler: Yes. It's also 2003.Monica: That means I may be done ovulating! I may also have served some very questionable meat at the restaurant!***Monica: [On the phone with Rachel, panicking because Emma's missing] Hey, Rach, by any chance, did you come by here and pick Emma up?Rachel: No, why?Monica: Oh, my...! Then that means...[Just then, Joey comes in the door holding Emma] Oh, Emma! Thank God! There you are!Rachel: [Worried] Wha-what do you mean "There you are"?! Where was she?!Monica: [Forgetting Rachel was still on the phone] Oh, uh, we were just playing peek-a-boo. She loves it when I'm dramatic. [Quickly hangs up]Monica: [To Joey] Why the hell did you take her?!Joey: Because you two were having [Whispers last word so Emma doesn't hear] sex!Monica: No, we weren't.Joey: Don't you lie to me. I can tell by Chandler's hair. [To Chandler] You are so lazy. Can't you get on top for once?Chandler: [Embarrassed, tries to fix his messy hair] All right, we were! We were trying to make a baby. Monica's ovulating.Joey: Which is more than I can say for myself as of 2:00 today. [He and Chandler laugh, and Joey indicates that he peed on Monica's ovulation sticks]Monica: You guys! Seriously, those sticks are expensive!Joey: Hey, it is unacceptable that you'd have sex with Emma in the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this.Monica and Chandler: No, no! Please don't. She'll kill us.Joey: Hey, I gotta. Unless...Chandler: Unless what?Joey: Unless you name your first-born child Joey.Chandler: What? Why?Joey: Hey, I may never have kids. And someone has to carry on my family name.Chandler: Your family name is Tribbiani.Joey: [Thinks this over for a few seconds] Oh-ho, you almost had me. [He leaves, and Chandler covers his face with his hands at the sheer ignorance of Joey]***Phoebe: Okay, I wasn't rich like you guys, okay? I didn't eat gold and have a flying pony. I had a hard life! My mother was killed by a drug dealer.Monica: Your mother killed herself!Phoebe: She was a drug dealer!***Joey:Oh...baby-proofing... Why is this such a big deal now? Y'know, when I was a kid it was like.. "Whoops! Joey fell down the stairs!" or er.. "Whoops! Joey electrocuted himself again!"***[Rachel tries to install baby-proofing things in the apartment.]Rachel: Are you saying that women can't do it?Joey: Women can do it; you can't.Rachel: Monica, will you please tell Joey that he's a pig?Monica: [to Joey] You're a pig. [to Rachel] And you can't do this.Rachel: Well, I found the hardware store by myself!Joey: The hardware store's just down the street.Rachel: There's a hardware store down the street?***[Monica and Chandler each borrow money from Joey, forcing him to lie to them both until they find out.]Rachel: Joey! Why did you tell Chandler that Monica was getting a boob job?Joey: Because she is!Monica: Joey, Chandler knows I borrowed the money.Joey: Mm-hmm! For your boob job!Monica, Rachel, Chandler: It's over, Joe!Joey: Okay. So I'm out four thousand dollars and nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?***Monica: Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as... [reads from the screen] "gay as the day is long"?Chandler: Because I told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.Monica: But that's clearly a joke. This could easily be true.***[The friends are about to arrange the lottery tickets, in a bowl at the breakfast table]Monica: We need to sort through the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we won. Does anybody have any ideas how to organize this? [abruptly] How about this - we divide them into six groups of forty, and the remaining ten can be read by whoever finishes their pile first.Rachel: [raising her hand] I have another idea!Monica: Sorry, idea time is over!Phoebe: Are all of the tickets in the bowl?Monica: Yeah.Chandler: What about the ones on the nightstand?Monica: There are no tickets on the nightstand!Chandler: Yes there are, I saw them a few minutes ago![Rachel goes to the nightstand to investigate]Monica: [uncomfortably] No you didn't! You must be mistaken!Chandler: There were twenty tickets on the nightstand!Monica: Chandler, sense the tone![Rachel returns with a bunch of tickets in her hand]Rachel: Well, well, well, look what Mommy found! [everyone gasps]Monica: Fine! I bought twenty extra tickets for me and Chandler!Phoebe: [gasps] The psychic also said that I would be betrayed!Ross: I can't believe this! I thought we were all in this together!Monica: You just got in five minutes ago!Ross: Three! I don't know why that's important!Joey: I was with you the whole time we were in Connecticut! When did you get those?Monica: When you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic!Joey: [sniggers and turns to Ross] I'll show you how!Rachel: Suppose one of your special tickets wins? How are you going to feel when you win the lottery and lose all your friends?Monica: If I win the lottery you guys are not going to leave me! Someone gave me a basket of mini muffins last week and I couldn't get rid of you for three days!Rachel: Chandler, would you tell her that what she did was wrong?!Chandler: [turns to Monica] She's right, you shouldn't have bought tickets just for us. [Monica gasps] Let me finish. [turns to Rachel] However, it doesn't look as though I'm going to get this job, so I can't afford to have principles. So screw you, the tickets are ours!! [snatches the tickets from an open-mouthed Rachel]Monica: [jubilantly] There's the man I married! [high-fives Chandler]Rachel: Believe me, if you win the lottery, it's the last you're going to hear from any of us!Monica: Fine! Don't be my friends! I'll buy new friends! And then I'll pay for their plastic surgeries so they look just like you!Rachel: That's it! I want my share of the tickets!Joey: [snatches the bowl from Rachel] I want my tickets too! And I'm buying the Knicks! And Steffi Graf!Ross: [snatches the bowl from Joey] I want mine too! And if I win I'm going to put it all into a very low-yield bond!Phoebe: [tries to put all the tickets into the bowl] You guys! We've got to keep all the tickets together!Monica: No! [snatches the bowl] We should divide them up, and I should get extra because we used my car to buy them!!Joey: If anybody gets extra tickets it should be me; this whole thing was my idea!! [snatches the bowl]Chandler: Oh yeah! Thanks for inventing the lottery!!***Monica: Why don't you take Ross?Ross: Uh, don't you think that would be a little weird? I mean, two guys in a romantic inn...Monica: No, not if their room has two beds!Ross: [Browsing the brochure] I guess... It still seems a little... [Enthusiastically] moonlight boat ride!***Phoebe: [playing guitar and singing] And there's a country called Argentinaaaa, it's a place I've never seeeeen. But I'm told for fifty pesos you can buy a human spleen. Humaaan spleeeeen. Ole!

[Showcases a top hat and hand-held glasses] This might class up 'The Ballad of the Uncircumcised Man'!Monica: Phoebe, maybe I wasn't clear before...I love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is an upscale place!Phoebe: I'll ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault!Monica: It's not what you wear, it's your songs! I don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore!Phoebe: [disappointed] Oh...OK. I'll take the hat back. [puts the hat back in the bag and stamps on it]Rachel: [After a pause] So...the funniest thing happened at work...Phoebe: [Interrupting, to Monica] My songs aren't good enough for your restaurant?!Rachel: We're still on that!Monica: I didn't say that!Phoebe: Then what's wrong with them? They don't go with your tiny portions of pretentious food?Monica: Tiny portions?!Phoebe: "Excuse me, I ordered the smoked salmon appetizer, but [Wears the glasses] I cahn't see it! I cahn't see it!"Monica: It's not about quantity!Phoebe: It's not about quality!Monica: You want to talk quality? Ever heard of a key?! It's what some people sing in!!Phoebe: At least my songs don't taste like garlic! [Monica opens her mouth] There are other ingredients!Monica: So that's what we're doing?! When I'm in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs, I'm wearing earplugs!Phoebe: Earplugs, or cloves of garlic?Monica: [Gets up abruptly] I take back what I said before! You keep playing, because with your music driving people inside, my bar sales have gone up like crazy!Phoebe: What are they having? The GARLIC MARTINI?!***Monica: Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated.Rachel: All right, all right! You're right, I won't do anything with Joey. I just thought it would be...[Joey walks in]Rachel: Okay... so that would be two cups of tarragon, one pound of baking soda and one red onion?Monica: What the hell are you cooking?***[Phoebe is about to give Rachel a massage]Phoebe: [in a fake Swedish accent] Hello, ya! It's time for your massage, ya! Put your face in the hole!Rachel: Oh, a Swedish massage from a real Swedish person!Phoebe: Then I'm Swedish!Rachel: What's your name?Phoebe: A normal Swedish name...Ikea.Rachel: What an interesting name. You know, I...Phoebe: [interrupts her and pushes her head down] Time for your scalp massage!Rachel: [sees Phoebe's shoes through the hole] Wow! I really love- [gasps loudly]Phoebe: Is something wrong?Rachel: No, it just...feels so good...Ikea! You'll know this, what's the capital of Sweden?Phoebe: Stockholm.Rachel: [to herself] Damn, I wish I knew if that was right!***Phoebe: [singing] Ipan stripan glupi glapi! And that's the Swedish National Anthem, thank you for asking!Rachel: Wow, what a rich culture! You know, I have a friend who's a masseuse!Phoebe: Oh, ya!Rachel: She's not very good, though!Phoebe: And why do you think that is?Rachel: I don't know! Maybe because she's got callousy fingers from playing a crummy guitar!Phoebe: Or maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you're such a high-maintenance tight-ass!Rachel: [turns up] PHOEBE!!Phoebe: You know it's me?Rachel: For a half-hour! Man, you can lie about Sweden!Phoebe: How can you come here?Rachel: How can you not tell me you work here?Phoebe: I don't have to tell you everything!Rachel: Yes you do, if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage!Phoebe: Tips not included.Rachel: Why did you lie to me about working here?Phoebe: I was ashamed! I sold out for the cash! They give me benefits like medical and dental and a 401! But you pay a price! Now I'm this corporate stooge, punching a clock, and paying taxes!Rachel: If you hate it, you should walk out there and quit! Be true to what you believe in! You have principles and I so admire that! I don't have any!Phoebe: You're right, I am going to quit! It's time I took my life back!Rachel: Good for you, Pheebs![Phoebe leaves the room, then looks up at the ceiling and whispers]Phoebe: If you guys had microphones in there, I didn't mean that! I love you!***[At Ross?s Conference]Ross: But all kidding aside, in much the same way that Homo ergaster is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus...[Joey laughs]Charlie: What?Joey: He said "erectus"!Charlie: You're... you're kidding, right?Joey: No, he really said it.Ross: ... and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus...[Rachel laughs]Joey: Erectus?Rachel: Homo.***Monica: David, can you help me?! I'm trying to explain to Chandler how a plane stays in the air.David: Oh, certainly. That's a combination of Bernoulli's principle and Newton's third law of motion.Monica: [To Chandler] See?Chandler: Yeah, that's the same as "it has something to do with wind".***Monica: Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.Chandler: [Smiling cheekily] I do! Want a hint? huh? "I do" [Monica looks confused, so Chandler repeats] "I do".Monica: Ok, I'm sensing that this is some kind of word play, because you are pink with barely controlled glee.Chandler: David is going to propose to Phoebe.Monica: What? [Looks very shocked] Why?Chandler: Be-cause, we were talking about ways that he could beat Mike and I told him that Phoebe wanted to get married.Monica: Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?Chandler: I did! A penis one!***Chandler: Now that I've untangled you, how about you do something for me?Monica: What do you have in mind?Chandler: I think you know.Monica: I really don't feel like it!Chandler: This is what I want to do.Monica: All right!

Very hot plate, very hot!Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!Ross: [laughs] That is gonna hurt tomorrow!***Ross:Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?Rachel: [to Joey and Charlie] Oh my, are we supposed to answer?Ross: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.***Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.Ross: [starts crying] I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining! I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.***[Joey and Chandler are discussing Joey's impending date with Rachel.]Chandler: Wow, so tonight might be the night. You nervous?Joey: Nah. This is the part I'm actually good at.Chandler: What must it be like not to be crippled by fear and self-loathing?Joey: It's okay!***Rachel: But do you think that maybe, on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?Joey: No, I don't have another level.***Ross: Is Emma awake yet?Rachel: It's still nap time. She'll be up soon.Ross: Where's Joey?Rachel: I said, it's still nap time.[Joey awakes from his nap.]Ross: There's Uncle Joey! Say something to Emma for her 18th birthday!Joey: [starts to turn on his charm for the camera] 18, huh?Ross: [switches off the camera] NO!Joey: It's for her hot friends!Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!Joey: And starting to think about settling down!***Rachel: Ross, don't forget to take a shot of Emma's cake. It's in a box in the fridge.Ross: Sure.Rachel: [to Monica] You're going to love this cake! I got from from a bakery in New Jersey, Carino's!Monica: That place has the creamiest frosting! I used to hitchhike there when I was a kid!Rachel: Well, they make make these great novelty cakes in different shapes; and if you give them a photo, they'll copy it in icing!Monica: Did you do a picture of Emma?Rachel: On a cake shaped like a bunny!Ross: Does this bakery by any chance bake erotic cakes, for bachelorette parties?Rachel: What are you talking? -OH, MY...! They put my baby's face on a penis![Everyone rushes to see the cake.]Phoebe: Now it's a party!Rachel: This is not funny! If I wanted this cake to be a disaster, I would have baked it myself!Joey: Is it okay that I still think it looks delicious?Judy: Jack, look at this!Jack: I know what you're thinking! The resemblance is uncanny![Everyone turns to look at Ross]Ross: [angry] I am THIS close to tugging on my testicles again!!Rachel: [on the phone] No, this is NOT what I ordered! I drove to New Jersey to get my daughter a cake for her birthday and I need a bunny cake right now!Ross: Ask them if it would be faster to cut the baby's face off the penis and put it on the bunny. [to himself] That is a weird sentence.Rachel: [on the phone with the bakery] Oh, believe you me, I am going to bring this cake back. I don't even want it in my home... JOEY, DON'T TOUCH IT!Joey: I'm so confused!Rachel: I still want my daughter's face on a cake, but a bunny cake! Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!Chandler: To be fair, this one does have nuts.***Chandler: Well, if I were a guy...[Everyone stares at him.]Chandler: Wait. Did I just say "If I were a guy"?***Joey: Finished my recommendation, and I think you'll be very, very happy. It's the longest I've ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.Chandler: I don't... understandJoey: Some of the words a little too sophisticated for you?Monica: It doesn't make any sense.Joey: Of course it does. It's smart. I used a thesaurus.Chandler: On every word?Joey: Yep!Monica: What was this sentence originally?Joey: Oh, "They're warm, nice people with big hearts."Chandler: And that became, "They're humid, prepossessing Homo sapiens with full-sized aortic pumps."Joey: And hey, I really mean it, dude.Monica: Uh, Joey, I don't think we can use this.Joey: Why not?Monica: Well, because you signed it "Baby Kangaroo" Tribbiani.***[Phoebe and Mike are planning their wedding.]Ross: There's no way around it, Pheebs. You just got to accept the fact that this is going to cost you a lot of money.Mike: I heard that weddings are, like, a 40 billion dollar a year industry.Ross: Yeah, and I'm responsible for just, like, half of that.***Ross: Brussels sprouts? That's worse than no food!***Rachel: To Monica and Chandler! And that knocked-up girl in Ohio!***Chandler: Look! Look what the-Look what the floating heads did!Monica: I don't care.Chandler: What's going on?Monica: That was the adoption agency.Chandler: And?Monica: We're getting a baby!Chandler: ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

And what about the amazing wainscoting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic?Chandler: And the wigglewoms and the zipzorps?... What were the things you said?***Ross: We think Chandler might be having an affair.Monica: What?Rachel: Phoebe and I saw Chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street, and then we followed them to a house in Westchester.Phoebe: They went in together.

I mean synchronized swimming, I mean the balance beam - help me!Ross: Football!Chandler: Thank you!***Ross: Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say hello to Mike's next groomsman.Chandler: Oh, I will! But I will need a mirror... as he is me!***Chandler: I know. I hate being left out of things.Ross: I know. And it's a wedding.

Then why didn't you say something?Rachel: Because it is too damn hard, Ross! I can't even begin to explain to you how much I am going to miss you. When I think about not seeing you every day, it makes me not want to go. Okay? So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else, you're wrong.
