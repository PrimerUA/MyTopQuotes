Barney: Haaaave you met Ted?
Ted: Long distance is a lie teenagers tell each other to get laid the summer before college.
Bilson: Nice tie! Steak sauce!
Barney: Have you seen how the kids are dressing these days, with the Ashlee and the Lindsay and the Paris? They all dress like strippers. It's, 'Go ho or go home.' Now ladies...SLUT UP!
***
Lily: There are certain things in life where you know it's a mistake but you don't really know it's a mistake because the only way to really know it is a mistake is to make that mistake and look back and say, 'Yup, that was a mistake'. So really, the bigger mistake would be to not make the mistake because then you'll go your whole life not really knowing if something is a mistake or not.
***
Ted(to Barney): Wait a minute. You're able to cross the threshold of a church?
***
Lily(seeing Barney‘s 300-inch flatscreen for the first time): It hurts my eyes...
Barney: Yeah, that doesn't go away.
***
Barney(talking with Lily about waiting in line for the wedding-dress sale): I can’t go, I’ve got this thing…
Lily: What thing?
Barney:...a penis.
***
Marshall: Oh, got it. Lily and Marshall Awesome. Hey have you met the Awesomes? Lily, Marshall, their son Totally, and their daughter Freaking?
***
Ted: What are you talking about? I got the low-maintenance, just-rolled-out-of-bed look.
Marshall: Which takes about an hour and a half of waxing, tugging and teasing to achieve.
Barney: And then he starts on his hair. Ace!
***
Barney: Oh, he's good. Classic seduction technique. I use it all the time. First, I buy her, and by her I mean you, a drink. Then I pretend to be interested in whatever she cares about, for you that would be the.. environment. I be all sympathetic and before you know it, you're naked in my apartment shouting, 'Oh-oh, Ba-ar-nee-ee-ee!' And by you, I mean her...
***
Barney(as Borat): I like Halloween very much. Is nice! [flashes thumbs-up]
Ted(in a Borat-style accent): Is also tomorrow.
Barney: Damn it!
***
Barney: Well, I go to Total Rip Fitness. But I don't work out there.
Ted: What do you do?
Barney: I invest.
***
Barney: Now remember my three beginner's tips for picking up chicks: address her by name, isolate her from her friends, subtly put her down.
***
Robin: Can we please, for the love of God, just order something now?
Ted: Chinese?
Barney: I don't like Chinese.
Ted: Indian?
Barney: I just said I don't like Chinese.
Ted: Indian isn't Chinese.
Barney: Weird meat, funny music, side of rice. Why are we splitting hairs?
Ted: Mexican?
Barney: I just said I don't like Chinese!
***
Ted(while Lily and Robin start fighting): Alright, alright! Break it up! BREAK IT UP!
Barney: Te-ed, no! You never break up a girl fight! NEVER!!!
***
Ted: He may not fit society's definition of a hero, but he is the hero I needed. The hero who helped me recover from the disaster of my failed almost-marriage and get back into the game. He lives in the shadows. Is he a dream? Truth? Fiction? Damnation? Salvation? He is all these things and none of them. He is...The Naked Man.
***
Marshall: If I could nail a celebrity it would be Lily. She's the star of my heart.
Lily: Aww. For me it would be Hugh Jackman.
***
Ted(talking about Bilson, who just fired him): After he proposed a vocational paradigm shift, I made an impromptu presentation using a four-prong approach which really brought him to his knees.
Barney: You hit him with a chair?
Ted: Yep.
Barney: That's my boy!
***
Barney: The only difference between my life and a porno is that my life has better lighting.
***
Barney(About something the happened the previous night): I couldn't be more unhappy! I mean she just walked out. At least when I walk out on a girl I have the common courtesy to sleep with her first. It's-it's called manners!
***
Barney(about his usual picture pose): I always look drop dead, stone-cold amazing...unlike Marshall, who just looks dead, stoned, and cold.
***
Barney: A lie is just a great story that someone ruined with the truth.
***
Ted: Oh, guess who I ran into [at the Architect's Ball]. A girl from my past. Any guesses?"
Lily: The girl who beat you up.
Barney: The girl who ruined a photo with Slash!
Marshall: The girl who made you get the butterfly tattoo?
Ted: You make it sound like I dated a series of Stieg Larsson novels.
***
Barney: And now to seal this sacred vow, the two ladies will kiss.
Robin: Barney!
Barney: The two ladies will kiss!
(Robin and Lily kiss and Robin tries to pull away, but Lily keeps kissing her)
Robin: Uh, Lily.
Lily: Sorry.
Barney: And now the gentlemen...
Ted: DUDE!
Barney: And now the gentlemen! (Marshall and Ted kiss) I was going to say 'And now the gentlemen bump fists.' How long you been holding back that one?
***
Barney: Because...I'm dating a stripper.
Ted: Yeah, I've seen the bus ad. I get it.
***
Barney: Let me choose your child‘s middle name. Because I have thought up the most awesome name of all time.
Marshall: What‘s the middle name?
Barney: Wait for it...
Marshall: I‘m wating.
Barney: Wait for it.
Marshall: What‘s the middle name?
Barney: No, the middle name is 'Wait For It'. Let‘s say his first name is, I don‘t know, Barney. He‘d be Barney 'Wait For It' Eriksen. How awesome is that?
Marshall: That is ... the coolest middle name of all time!
***
Barney: When I‘m sad, I stop being sad and be awesome instead.
***
Ted: Robin, just...I appreciate your help, but there‘s a reason your name is Robin, not Batman.
Barney: There are so many great things to do with the human mouth. Why waste it on talking?
***
Ted: We should buy a bar.
Barney: OF COURSE we should buy a bar!
***
Barney: I‘m sorry, can you repeat this? I don‘t speak I-never-get-laid.
***
Barney: It‘s gonna be legen-...wait for it...-dary! Legendary!
***
Barney: Suit Up!
***
Barney: It's going to be legendary! 
Ted: Don't say that! You're too liberal with the word "legendary". 
[flashback to Barney standing at Ted's door in snow gear with a shovel] 
Barney: We're building an igloo in Central Park! It's going to be legendary! Snow-suit up! 
***
Marshall: I think we're going to wait on the baby thing. I mean I love babies. Babies rule. Pudgy arms and stuff. But, uh, they make you old. Kinda like this anchor weighing you down to one spot... forever. 
Claire: I'm three months pregnant. 
Marshall: [surprised] Not awkward, guys. Not awkward if we don't let it be awkward. 
[nervously smiles, then walks away] 
***
Barney: Elbert "Ickey" Woods, the Bengals were fools to cut you in '91. Your 1,525 rushing yards and 27 touchdowns will not be forgotten. So, Coach Dave Shula, screw you and your crappy steakhouse! 
***
Barney: Was that chick at the end really a client? 
***
Barney: Suit up! 
***
Ted: I'm gonna do what that guy couldn't, I'm gonna take the plunge... Well, I guess that's not a perfect metaphor since... for me it's falling in love and for him it's... death. 
Barney: Actually, that is a perfect metaphor. 
***
Ted: Can we maybe scoop stuffing for a while? 
Barney: You wanna scoop stuffing on your first day? 
[sarcastically makes phone with his hands and holds it to his ear] 
Barney: Hello, NFL, can I be quarterback next Sunday? 
***
Barney: Ted, your problem is all you do is think, think, think. I'm teaching you how to do, do, do. 
Marshall: Doo-doo! 
[laughs] 
Barney: [chuckles] Totally. 
***
Ted: At least someone appreciates the fact that I am doing and not thinking. 
[pause] 
Ted: And now, I don't think I won't not go to the bathroom. 
***
Lily: You're playing hockey. With a basketball... and tennis rackets? 
Marshall: It's BaskIceball, the greatest game ever. We invented it. it's Awesome! 
Lily: Wait, BaskIceball? shouldn't it be Iceketball? 
Marvin Eriksen Sr.: Ice... Ket... ball? that just sounds weird. 
Marcus Eriksen: The game is BaskIceball. And I'm the best. 
Lily: Well, maybe that's just cause you haven't seen *me* play. 
[Lily throws the basketball to Marcus who throws it back to Marshall] 
Marshall: Well, it's not exactly a sport for girls. 
Lily: Well, that's funny cause your brother throws like a girl! 
[Lily throws the ball back to Marcus] 
Lily: [Marcus throws the ball hard and hits Lily in the face] 
***
Lily: Hey, nice shirt, Ted. Is it yesterday already? 
***
Barney: Ted, tonight we're gonna go out. We're gonna meet some ladies, it's gonna be *legendary*. Phone-five! 
[slaps cell-phone] 
Barney: You didn't phone-five, did you? 
[pause] 
Barney: I know when you don't phone-five Ted. 
***
Marshall: I'm not a gay pirate, I have sex with my parrot all the time! 
[there is an awkward silence] 
Marshall: OK, that came out wrong. 
***
Ted: You're not... Moby, are you? 
Not Moby: Who? 
Ted: The recording artist, Moby. 
Not Moby: Oh, no. 
Ted: Then why, when we said "Hey, Moby" did you come over here? 
Not Moby: Oh, I thought you said Tony. 
Ted: So your name's Tony? 
Not Moby: No. 
***
Lily: [Lily sees Barney hitting on Claudia] Oh, hell. No! 
[grabs Barney by the ear and yanks him away from Claudia] 
Lily: Claudia is getting married tomorrow and so help me God if I catch you even so much as breathing the same air as her I will take those peanuts you're trying to pass off as testicles and I will squeeze them so hard until your eyes pop out and then I'll feed them to you like grapes. 
Barney: [confused] Wait... my eyes? Or my testicles? 
Lily: [pause, thinks about it] One of each! 
***
Marshall: A drumroll? So what? that's it? You just said good night, went home and... performed the drum solo? 
***
Barney: Haaaaave you met Ted? 
***
Barney: It's gonna be legen... wait for it... dary! 
***
Barney: It's gonna be legend-... wait for it... and I hope you're not lactose intolerant because the second half of that word is DAIRY! 
***
Barney: What's that left hand? Right hand suck? Word! 
***
Barney: What's that? Self five? Nice! We out! 
***
Ted: So, who are we picking up? 
Barney: I dunno... her? Or maybe her... 
Ted: Wait, so when you said we were going to pick someone up at the airport, you meant we were going to *pick someone up* at the airport? 
Barney: Yeah... 
Ted: You're kidding! 
Barney: False! 
***
Ted: Hey Barney, see that girl? 
Barney: Ohhh yeah, you just know she likes it dirty! 
***
Barney: Moist. 
[repeated during Barney's play to get back at Lily] 
***
Ted: [whenever Marshall and Lily talk about having sex] Please don't. 
***
Ranjit: Hello! 
***
Lily: You son of a bitch! 
***
Barney: Challenge accepted!
