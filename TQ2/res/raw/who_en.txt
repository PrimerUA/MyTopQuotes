***
"Oh, yes I can [remember my family] when I want to. And that's the point really. I have to really want to bring them back in front of my eyes. The rest of the time they...they sleep in my mind and I forget. And so will you. Oh, yes, you will. You'll find there's so much else to think about, to remember. Our lives are different to anybody else's. That's the exciting thing. There's nobody in the universe can do what we're doing." ~The Doctor

"Wonderful thing, pain. Without pain, no race could survive." ~Dr. Carter
***
"The data that was drained from the girl shows the Doctor's long association with libertarian causes. His entire history is one of opposition to conquest. While he lives, he is a threat." ~Chedaki
***
"What are you, exactly? Some sort of wandering Armageddon peddler?" ~Adam Colby
***
"We're beset by a wandering lunatic." ~Adam Colby about The Doctor

***
"Homo sapiens... What an inventive, invincible species. It's only a few million years since they crawled up out of the mud and learned to walk. Puny, defenseless bipeds. They've survived flood, famine, and plague. They've survived cosmic wars and holocausts. And now, here they are, out among the stars, waiting to begin a new life, ready to out-sit eternity. They're indomitable. Indomitable. What do you think you're doing, Harry?" ~The Doctor
***
"My doctorate is purely honorary, and Harry here is only qualified to work on sailors." ~The Doctor
***
"For once in my life, I feel surplus to requirement." ~The Doctor

"That is nasty. Better not tell Harry - he's gone first." ~The Doctor
***
"Explosives AND detonators. Seems almost providential." ~The Doctor
***
"If you two could put your weight on the door and stop it opening too suddenly... I don't want to lose my arm, I'm rather attached to it. It's so handy." ~The Doctor
***
"'Fragmetize'? Oh, well. I suppose we can't expect decent English from a machine." ~The Doctor
***
"Careful, careful! I might explode!" ~The Doctor
***
"That's the trouble with ideas - they only come a bit at a time." ~The Doctor
***

"Some sort of primeval mating call...If my theory is correct, we're going to have to handle this very, very carefully." ~The Doctor, proving that sometimes Torchwood _would_ come in handy
***
"I'm not a party to any kind of nonsense. Your grace." ~The Doctor
***
"Well, it takes all sorts to make a galaxy, your grace." ~The Doctor
***
"You can't rule the world in hiding. You've got to come out onto the balcony sometimes and wave a tentacle...if you'll pardon the expression." ~The Doctor
***
"Very good, very good! Almost impressive!" ~The Doctor
***
"Right! Let's see what other damage we can do!" ~The Doctor
***
"Yes, that's the TARDIS. And I'm going to pilot it all the way to London. I can be there five minutes ago." ~The Doctor
***
"It's tempting to let them go ahead and destroy themselves. The trouble is, they wouldn't be the only ones." ~The Doctor
***
"[The ship will be dragged down] faster and faster. Until, of course, we reach the surface, then we'll stop. With a bang." ~The Doctor
***
"Usually I only entertain friends in the TARDIS." ~The Doctor
***
"You and I are scientists, Professor. We buy our privilege to experiment at the cost of total responsibility." ~The Doctor

"Come on, Sarah. We've an appointment in London, and we're already 30,000 years late." ~The Doctor
***
"I'm not a human being; I walk in eternity." ~The Doctor
***
"If I knew, I wouldn't ASK. Don't be obtuse, man!" ~The Doctor

"I have the advantage of being slightly ahead of you. Sometimes behind you, but normally ahead of you....I'm sure you don't [understand], but it's very nice of you to try." ~The Doctor
***
"I often think dimensional transcendentalism is preposterous, but it works." ~The Doctor
***
"We don't want to be blamed for starting a fire, do we? I had enough of that in 1666." ~The Doctor
***
"Well, yes and no. Or no and yes. So to speak. As it were." ~The Doctor
***
"Don't worry, Sarah. Who'll notice me?" ~The Doctor

"You thought I was dead! You're always making that mistake." ~The Doctor

"All [divination] takes is a good imagination and a glib tongue." ~The Doctor
***
"He takes away from man the only thing worth having...a sense of purpose, what else? The ability granted to every intelligent species to shape its own destiny." ~The Doctor
***
"Oh, come off it, Hieronymous, you know who I am! You can drop all that bosh about sacred stones and profanity and just be your natural, horrid self." ~The Doctor

"It's part of a Time Lord's job to insist on justice for all species." ~The Doctor

"Nothing happened. A sort of unexplosion has taken place." ~The Doctor

"Eldrad, you'll achieve nothing on Kastria unless you overcome this paranoid obsession with treachery. You MUST cooperate." ~The Doctor giving a bit of advice we could all use

"I deny this reality. The reality is a computation matrix." ~The Doctor

"I can feel my hair curling. And that means either it's going to rain, or that I'm on to something." ~The Doctor

***
"Gods don't use transceivers." ~The Doctor
***
"Answers are easy. It's asking the right questions which is hard." ~The Doctor
***
"The very powerful and the very stupid have one thing in common - they don't alter their views to fit the facts, they alter the facts to fit their views. Which can be uncomfortable if you happen to be one of the facts that needs altering." ~The Doctor

***
"Right now, he must be a happy little maniac." ~The Doctor
***
"I see. You're one of those boring maniacs who's going to gloat. Are you going to tell me your plan for running the universe?" ~The Doctor
***
"I've always enjoyed messing about in boats." ~The Doctor
***
"My dear Litefoot, I've got a lantern, a pair of waders, and possibly the most fearsome piece of artillery in all of England. What can possibly go wrong?" ~The Doctor, who is evidently rather na�ve

***
"Do you think your little speck in the galaxy is the only one with intelligent life? Hm?" ~The Doctor
***
"That's the trouble with computers - always thinking in black and white. No aquamarines, no blues, no imagination." ~The Doctor
***
"Rutan, that's the empty rhetoric of a defeated dictator. And I don't like your face, either." ~The Doctor
***
"The virus has a perfect right to exist as a virus, not as a giant swarm threatening the entire solar system. Everything has its place, otherwise the delicate balance of the whole cosmos is destroyed." ~The Doctor

"Good morning ladies! Now, which one of you has the time scanner, hm?" ~The Doctor to cows

***
"I love fruitcake." ~The Doctor, admitting to cannibalism
***
"I like a jacket with a lot of pockets, don't you?" ~The Doctor

***
"I have a gift for the apt phrase." ~The Doctor
***
"Why don't you listen to me, huh? Why don't you girls listen to me?" ~The Doctor to Leela
***
"That's intensely interesting. Do you realize there's nowhere to go? We're on the edge of the cosmos, the frontiers of creation, the boundary between what is and isn't...or isn't yet, anyway. Don't you think that's interesting?...I feel just like a goldfish looking out on a new world." ~The Doctor
***
"I've never been more serious in any of my lives." ~The Doctor
***
"Anyone who likes jelly babies can't be all bad." ~The Doctor

"I'll never be cruel to an electron in a particle accelerator again!" ~The Doctor
***
"Bafflegab, my dear. I've never heard such bafflegab in all my lives." ~The Doctor
***
"Yes, pow. Pow...pow's a...pow's a technical expression, Professor. It means that all the microcircuits will be fused in one great UEGH of molten metal." ~The Doctor
***
"If they do break through, run as if something very nasty were after you, because something very nasty will be after you." ~The Doctor
***
"That takes me back...or forward. That's the trouble with time travel - you can never remember." ~The Doctor
***
"Do you mind not standing on my chest? My hat's on fire." ~The Doctor

"Listen, Romana, whenever you go into a new situation, you must always believe the best until you find out exactly what the situation's all about. THEN believe the worst." ~The Doctor
***
"I've stopped the universe! Still, they'll never notice. Just think - someone somewhere has just slipped on a banana skin, and he'll be wondering forever when he's going to hit the ground." ~The Doctor

***
"I guess you could say 'the yoke's on him,' if you were the sort of person who said that sort of thing, which fortunately I'm not." ~The Doctor
***
"Idiots? They're worse than idiots, they're bureaucrats. They just exist to tangle people up; wrap them round and round in red tape until they can't move." ~The Doctor
***
"What could possibly go wrong? OH! You know, I've simply _got_ to stop saying that. Every time I say 'What could possibly go wrong?' something goes wr--OH! It's uncanny, isn't it?" ~The Doctor
***
"Fascinating, isn't it? I wonder what it would be like to be crushed into a singularity...?" ~The Doctor

"You've got a lot to unlearn." ~The Doctor on human understanding of science
***
"Some galactic hobo with ideas above his station - the cosmos is full of them." ~The Doctor

***
"Knowing's easy - everyone does that ad nauseam. I just sort of hope." ~The Doctor
***
"Someone's gotta stay on guard. And you can compute a reverse transition from existing data - you love doing that!" ~The Doctor to K-9
***
"You know, I've never been one for swarming, It's awfully kind of you, but where were you thinking of swarming to?" ~The Doctor
***
"Pst! You are wonderful." ~The Doctor to Romana II

***
"One good, solid hope's worth a cartload of certainties." ~The Doctor
***
"The old home universe..." ~The Doctor
***

"If I knew everything that was going to happen, where would the fun be?" ~The Doctor
***
"Time reveals everything, Adric." ~The Doctor

***
"Professor Litefoot has been explaining to me about tea. It's very complicated." ~Leela

"Oh, [The Doctor]'s always in trouble, Tegan. Or hadn't you noticed? It amuses him." ~Adric
***
"What do you do with a cocktail in a bath?!" ~Adric

"You're a very confusing person to be with, Doctor, you know that?" ~Peri Brown

"I wonder, boy: what would you do if you were me? Hmm? Or perhaps I should ask, 'What would I do if I were me?'" ~The Doctor channeling his first incarnation

"I think it does us good to be reminded that the universe isn't entirely peopled with nasty creatures out for themselves." ~The Doctor
***
"I feel quite like my old self. Well....Well...Whoever I feel like, it's absolutely splendid." ~The Doctor
***
"Last time I was [at Heathrow], they were doing strange things to Terminal Three." ~The Doctor
***
"Well, take the advice of a madman and look happy!....Try to look as if you're enjoying yourself - in these situations, it's the best form of defense. And it gives me time to think." ~The Doctor
***
"There you are, Tegan: there's always something to look at, if you open your eyes." ~The Doctor
***
"Whatever it is, it could be distinctly unfriendly." ~The Doctor
***
"Adric, there is a difference between serious, scientific investigation and meddling....ISN'T there?!" ~The Doctor
***
"Intentions unknown, hypothesis: unfriendly, as K-9 would say." ~The Doctor
***
"Look, if we turn out to be hostile, then fair enough. Until we do, why not give us the benefit of the doubt? It's common sense, really, don't you think?" ~The Doctor
***
"An apple a day keeps the, uh... No, never mind." ~The Doctor
***
"Oh, good. That is good news, isn't it? If in doubt, then fire and acid every time, don't you think?" ~The Doctor
***
"Oh, he'll be alright. He was just driven out of his mind - just what he needed." ~The Doctor
***
"I think paradise is a little too green for me, as well." ~The Doctor
***
"Try to understand something, Adric - because you get away with something, it doesn't justify it." ~The Doctor
***
"Next time you want to escape from somewhere, _walk_." ~The Doctor
***
"I've met kings, emperors, megalomaniacs in my time." ~The Doctor
***
"What's the matter, old girl? Why this compulsion for planet Earth?" ~The Doctor, asking the question the audience had been wondering for nigh-on two decades
***
"Why do I always let my curiosity get the better of me?" ~The Doctor
***
"You said he was a friend from Brazil....Where the nuts come from." ~The Doctor
***
"E-Space is another universe! There isn't a taxi service goes back and forth!" ~The Doctor
***
"Well, that isn't right. Or is it?" ~The Doctor
***
"I want to announce my PRESENCE!" ~The Doctor
***
"If the freighter crashes into Earth with you on board, won't that make it rather difficult for you to carry out your task? I mean, you would be very crumpled." ~The Doctor
***
"For some people, small, beautiful events is what life is all about!" ~The Doctor
***
"We can't have a navigational hazard like that hanging about the galaxy." ~The Doctor about a random rift through the middle of Heathrow
***
"It's times like this I wish I still had my scarf." ~The Doctor
***
"You know how it is - put things off for a day, and suddenly it's a hundred years later." ~The Doctor
***
"The sixth face of Delusion is the wearer's own. That was probably the idea, don't you think?" ~The Doctor
***
"I tried keeping a diary once. Not chronological, of course, but the trouble with time travel is one never seems to find the time." ~The Doctor
***
"Curiosity's always been my downfall." ~The Doctor
***
"I AM telling the truth. I KEEP telling the truth. Why is it no one believes me?" ~The Doctor
***
"I owe it to my friend to try, because I got her into this." ~The Doctor
***
"Hello. I'm here to read the meter." ~The Doctor
***
"Zombies appear to have very nimble fingers." ~The Doctor
***
"I don't know what this Doctor's qualifications are, but if you ask me, the man's a lunatic." ~Heathrow Security Guard
***
"We sent armed guards when a friendly face and a welcoming hand would have sufficed. Are you surprised that he resisted?" ~Councilor Hedin
***
"You have the mouth of a prattling jackanapes. But your eyes...they tell a different story." ~Sharaz Jek to The Doctor
***
"My dad used to say that 'if' is the most powerful word in the English language." ~Tegan Jovanka
***
"A landing's a landing..." ~Tegan Jovanka
***
"Why do you always have some incomprehensible answer?" ~Tegan Jovanka to The Doctor
***
"I don't fancy a non-stop mystery tour of the galaxy." ~Tegan Jovanka, indicating that she is on the wrong show
***
"You're weird, Turlough." ~Tegan Jovanka
***
"In thirty years of soldiering, I have never encountered such destructive power as I have seen displayed here and now by the British school boy." ~Brigadier Alistair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart
***
"The universe is purged of The Doctor and his impossible dreams of goodness." ~The Master

***
"Obey the shiny one." ~Chief Elder Timanov

"You look so sweet when you get angry." ~Vislor Turlough, about to get a smack

"The worst place in the universe - English public school on Earth." ~Vislor Turlough
***
"Look after him, won't you? He gets into the most terrible trouble." ~Vislor Turlough to Peri Brown about The Doctor
***
"It's only a little radiation sickness between friends." ~Peri Brown
***
"Every time you sound confident now a days, something terrible seems to happen." ~Peri Brown
***
"I love games, Doctor. Games where I'm not expecting to end up dead." ~Peri Brown

"You certainly specialize in arcane knowledge." ~Peri Brown to The Doctor

***
"My outward appearance is of no importance whatsoever." ~The Doctor
***
"[Five] had a sort of...feckless charm. Simply wasn't me." ~The Doctor
***
"Regeneration in my case is a swift but volcanic experience, a sort of violent biological eruption, in which the body cells are displaced, changed, renewed, and rearranged. There are bound to be side effects." ~The Doctor
***
"I'm a knight errant, not an errant fool." ~The Doctor
***
"The purpose of reconnaissance is to gather information, not to finish up face-down in a pool of one's own blood." ~The Doctor
***
"You have a nasty habit of pinpointing the truth, young man." ~The Doctor to Hugo Lang
***
"I may be behaving like a manic barometer, but don't shrug off help when it's offered." ~The Doctor

"Of course I'm all right! I'm certainly all right! It's the situation that's all wrong." ~The Doctor, who is rather more forceful than the Tenth
***
"See it more as a mental stroll in a sea of psychic tranquility." ~The Doctor
***
"In my time, I have been threatened by experts. I don't rate you very highly at all." ~The Doctor
***
"You seem to forget, Peri, I'm not only from another culture, but another planet. I am in your terms an alien. I am therefore bound to have different values and customs." ~The Doctor

***
"The Rani is a genius. Shame I can't stand her." ~The Doctor

"No thanks, I've given them up. Guns can seriously damage your health, you know." ~The Doctor
***
"What's the use of a good quotation if you can't change it?" ~The Doctor
***
"I was imparting a little information! If you ask a question, you should listen to the answer, my girl. Otherwise, you will gain absolutely no benefit from being in my company. It is the province of knowledge to speak, and the privilege of wisdom to listen." ~The Doctor
***
"It's Jamie! How did he get here? He should be with me!" ~The Doctor

***
"America doesn't have a monopoly on bad taste." ~The Doctor
***
"I never thought precognizance of my own death would be so disturbing." ~The Doctor
***
"Even I would find it hard to lose myself in a corridor." ~The Doctor

***
"I can't rid m'self of the feeling I'm being used." ~The Doctor
***
"I'm subject to whims, I'm told." ~The Doctor
***
"No. More a sort of clown, actually. Would you care to hear my rendering of 'On With the Motley'?" ~The Doctor's response to "What are you, a comedian?"
***
"Um... Time is a comparative concept, commodore." ~The Doctor
***
"'Satiable curtiosity.' Like the Elephant's Child." ~The Doctor
***
"In all my travelings across the universe, I have battled against evil. Against power-mad conspirators. I should have stayed here! The oldest civilization, decadent, degenerate, and rotten to the core. Power-mad conspirators, Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen... They're still in the nursery compared to us! Ten million years of absolute power; that's what it takes to be REALLY corrupt!" ~The Doctor
***
"Oh. Oh, what an unpleasant journey." ~The Doctor
***
"I've always been a bit of an iconclast by nature." ~The Doctor
***
"This is a very odd waiting room. Where are the hopelessly out of date magazines?" ~The Doctor

"This is an illusion! I deny it!" ~The Doctor
***
"Unless we are prepared to sacrifice our lives for the good of us all, then evil and anarchy will spread like the plague." ~The Doctor

"I have no doubt that you could augment an earwig to the point where it understood nuclear physics, but it would still be a stupid thing to do!" ~The Second Doctor
***
"Do keep out of my way in the future and the past, there's a good fellow. The time continuum should be big enough for the both of us. Just." ~The Second Doctor to the Sixth

***
"What's he up to now? It'll be something devious and over-complicated. He'd get dizzy if he tried to walk in a straight line." ~The Rani about The Master

"Grandiose schemes of ruling the universe will mean nothing if that dilettante Doctor is still at large." ~The Rani
***
"Oh, Doctor, you do have the knack of landing yourself in hot water." ~Rudge

***
"What you wear is high fashion and ice hot for an old one." ~Bin Liner
***
"Yes, you've changed outwardly, but I'm sure you must still have the same sweet nature." ~Melanie Bush
***
"They kidnapped the Doctor. And no one would do that unless they were desperate for his help; he's not exactly predictable." ~Melanie Bush
***
"If you could bend that BACK into shape and put it back where it came from, it might be of more use." ~Melanie Bush to Pex
***
"Who said anything about home? I've got much more crazy things to do, yet." ~Melanie Bush
***
"How'd you know what I'm like? I've Regenerated. I mean, look at me. Look at me!" ~The Doctor

"Absence makes the nose grow longer." ~The Doctor
***
"More hasta, less vista." ~The Doctor

***
"I came here under a white flag, and I will leave here under that same white flag. And woe betide any man who breeches its integrity." ~The Doctor
***
"It's our only choice...apart from plan B - RUN!" ~The Doctor
***
"I've regenerated. The difference is purely perceptual." ~The Doctor
***
"Glitz, I sympathise with your disappointment, but I'm about to plummet to my death!" ~The Doctor
***
"I think we go straight on. Either that, or we don't." ~The Doctor
***
"Where have I heard of it before? I mean, where was it? Was it in the past, or is it in the future?" ~The Doctor
***
"Funny old business, time. It delights in frustrating your plans." ~The Doctor
***
"That's right, you're going. You've been going for ages. You're already gone. You're still here. You've just arrived. I haven't even met you yet. It all depends on who you are and how you look at it. Strange business, time....I'm sorry, Mel. Think about me when you're living your life one day after another, all in a neat pattern. Think about the homeless traveler in his old police box, his days like crazy paving." ~The Doctor
***
"Lack of food makes you obstreperous." ~The Doctor to Ace

"Ace, give me some of that Nitro 9 that you're not carrying." ~The Doctor
***
"You can always judge a man by the quality of his enemies." ~The Doctor
***
"Your species has the most amazing capacity for self-deception matched by only its ingenuity when trying to destroy itself." ~The Doctor
***
"Frightening, isn't it, to find that there are others better versed at death than human beings." ~The Doctor
***
"When I say 'Stay put,' I mean 'Stay put.' Not 'Take on an entire Dalek assault squad single-handed." ~The Doctor
***
"Dalek hunting is a terminal pastime." ~The Doctor
***
"Daleks are such boring conversationalists." The Doctor
