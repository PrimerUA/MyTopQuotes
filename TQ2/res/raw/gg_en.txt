Some might call this a fustercluck. But on the Upper East Side, we call it Sunday afternoon.***
Spotted -- Lonely Boy's rude awakening. Upper East Side Queens aren't born at the top. They climb their way up in heels, no matter who they have to tread on to do it.***
Spotted - Chuck Bass losing something nobody even knew he had. His heart.***
Sometimes you need to step outside, clear your head and remind yourself of who you are. And where you wanna be. And sometimes you have to venture outside your world in order to find yourself. As for me, I'm happy right where I am. I only wanna be with you. xoxo ... Gossip Girl***
There's a weak link in every chain. And it's just a matter of time before this one snaps.***
When words get in the way, there's really only one thing left to do.***
Chuck Bass waiting for the Jitney. A dozen roses in one hand, his heart in the other. You know what they say: A man is a good thing to come home for. But an even better thing to come home with Ain't karma a bitch? We know Blair Waldorf is.***
One thing about being on the top of the world.. it gives you a long, long way to fall.***
They say every action has an equal and opposite reaction, and once something is set on motion, it can't help up to build a momentum.***
Every happy ending is just a new beginning. Because on the Upper East Side, the good times never lasts forever.***
They say the universe has a great sense of humor. That sometimes having your dreams come true can feel like a nightmare. Because getting what you want always come with strings attached.***
A wise woman once said that every morning when you wake up you say a little prayer. After all, you never know what your day may hold.***
Nothing says January like a brand new Cold War.***
So if you want peace, always be prepared for war.***
But our most dangerous enemies are the ones we never knew we had.***
Napoleon once said that secrets travel fast in Paris. But Gossip Girl travels faster. Bisou bisou.***
The only thing lamer than dating Dan Humphrey... is mourning Dan Humphrey.***
My father left my mother for a 31-year-old model. A male model.***
When Prince Charming found Cinderella's slipper, they didn't accuse him of having a foot fetish.***
I don't read Gossip Girl. That's for chicks.***
Google revenge and you get BlairWaldorf.com.***
So actually I'll be living out my nightmare. Trapped in the city with only Blair Waldorf to talk to.***
Funny, Brown doesn't offer a degree in slut.***
I'm not a stop along the way. I'm a destination. And if you refuse to come, I'm gonna need to find a replacement... girls, the waiting list?***
Nothing hurts more than sleeping with a best friend.***
I would be in my cabana at the Hotel de Cat, and there he would be. Amid all the fireworks on Bastille Day, all I could see was that... Chuck Bass-tard!***
A hot lifeguard is like kleenex! Use once and throw away. You could ask for a better rebound!***
Damn that mother Chucker!***
Only a masochist could ever love such a narcissist.***
I have a friend on cyberspace who knows just what to do. XOXO.***
Can you make sure they don't seat me behind Caroline Kennedy? She may be American royalty, but she's a giraffe.***
Serena's been in jail for four hours, she's already served more time than Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie combined!***
Nate can't wait to see you. Trust me, it's like riding a very cute bike.***
A woman remembers.***
Guess I must have some undiagnosed brain injury. 'Cause I stupidly thought that this fake friendship might be real.***
Hillary Clinton is one of my role models. I do not break treaties, you ass!***
I'm the best of the best. I'm Blair Waldorf.***
Here's my advice. Have a little faith, and if that doesn't work, have a lot of mimosas.***
Just because we can't be friends doesn't mean we aren't.***
I don't love you anymore. But it takes more than even you to destroy a Blair Waldorf.***
Trust me, the only thing wrong with Chuck is that I'm going to be happy without him.***
All summer I've been sitting in front of my favorite Manet and reading Colette in the park. Hoping that I'll lock eyes with somebody who's doing the same thing as me. Or feeling the same thing as I am. But alas, not effective. For all my efforts I'm heading back home with a Chuck-sized cloud above my head.

Sometimes a queen has to make a choice: a castle with a white knight, or a quest with a dark prince.
***
The problems start when we refuse to let change happen, and cling to old habits.
***
Sometimes reality comes crashing into us. Other times it dawns on us slowly, despite our best efforts to ignore it.
***
If two people are meant to be together, eventually they'll find their way back.
***
Whoever said that money doesn't buy happiness didn't know where to shop.
***
Sometimes, even the best laid plans fall apart. Or you hit a wall when you were expecting a door.
***
I don't think I'm ready. I still miss Dan sometimes. More than sometimes. All the time.
***
Please, just stop.Even if it hurts me, be real with me for a second and tell me the truth.
***
…if you have feelings for someone, nothing else in the world matters.
***
I'm sorry for losing my temper the night you told me Louis proposed to you. I'm sorry for not waiting longer at the Empire State building. I'm sorry for treating you like property. I'm sorry I didn't tell you I loved you when I knew I did.
***
But most of all, I'm sorry that I gave up on us when you never did.
***
You're nobody until you're talked about…
***
8 letters, 3 words, say it & I am yours…
***
And who am I? That's a secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. Xo Xo. Gossip girl.
***
(One day you are muse — the next an old news).
***
Growing up means one thing — independence. We all want it. Sometimes we use other people to try to get it for ourselves. Sometimes we find it in each other. Sometimes our independence comes at the cost of something else. And that cost can be high. Because more often than not, in
order to gain our independence we have to fight. Never give up — never surrender.
***
The brightest stars burn out the fastest.

If there's one thing I've learned it's that there would be no gossip without secrets.
You might be brave enough to reveal your secret only to have it used against you. Or someone else's secret might affect you in enexpected ways. There are some secrets you're only too happy to keep. Others surface only to be buried away deeper than they were before. But the most powerful secrets are the truths you thought you could never reveal. That once spoken,change everything.
***
Jealousy is a powerful emotion,I Had to create a monster if i was going to dethrone a queen.
***
Sometimes you need to step outside,clear your head…and remind yourself of who you are. And where you wanna be.
***
The biggest present comes in the smallest box.
***
B: I Know you. You are Chuck Buss!
C: I'm not Chuck Buss without you..
***
Chuck: It's just a game. I hate to lose. You're free to go.
Serena: Chuck, why did you just said that?
Chuck: …because I love her… and I can't make her happy.
***
Chuck: Please don't leave with him.
Blair: Why? Give me a reason… and “I'm Chuck Bass” doesn't count.
Chuck: 'Cause you don't want to.
Blair: That's not enough.
Chuck: 'Cause I don't want you to.
Blair: That's not enough.
Chuck: What else is there?
The true reason I should stay right where I am and not get in the car. Three words. Eight letters. Say it… that I'm yours.
Chuck: I… I … [pause]
Blair: Thank you. That's all I needed to hear.
***
And no matter how long you try to be good, you cant keep a bad girl down.
***
— It's just a game. I hate to lose. You're free to go.
— Chuck, why did you just said that?
-…because I love her… and I can't make her happy…
***
— Your world would be easier if I didn't come back.
— That's true. But It wouldn't be my world without you in it.
***
But I am me. And you are you. We're Chuck and Blair. Blair and Chuck. The worst think you've ever done, the darkest thought you've even had, I will stand by you trough anything. Because I love you!
***
— Being amicable isn’t in our blood. We can't be friends. Friends have to like each other. And I’ll never like you.
— I'll never like you, either. In fact, I hate you.
— I hate you, too.
***
Blair: - You're a disgusting,and i hate you!
Chuck: - Then why are you still holding my hand?
***
Unlike the rest of us, sex, lies and scandal never take a vacation.
***
Destiny is for losers. It's just a stupid excuse to wait for things to happen instead of making them happen.
