Jack: [about airplane turbulence] It's normal.
Rose: Oh, I know, I just never been a really good flyer. My husband keeps reminding me that planes wanna be in the air.
Jack: He sounds like a very smart man.
***
Kate: [as she is about to stitch up Jack's wound] Any color preference?
Jack: Nah, standard black.
Kate: I might throw up on you.
Jack: You're doing fine.
***
Jack: [as Boone is trying to give CPR to Rose] Stop! Her head's not tilted back enough, you're blowing air into her stomach.
Boone: Are you sure? That was exactly what I was doing. I'm a lifeguard, I'm licensed.
Jack: Yeah, well you seriously need to think about giving that license back.
Boone: Maybe we should do one of those hole things? You know, stick the pen in the throat?
Jack: [sarcastically] Yeah, good idea, you go get me a pen!
Boone: Hey, does anyone have a pen?
***
Sayid: You'd think they would've come by now.
Charlie: What? Who?
Sayid: Anyone.
***
Charlie: That’s French! The French are coming! I’ve never been so happy to hear the French!
***
Boone: Someone else was stranded here?
Charlie: Guys... where are we?
***
Locke: [talking about Backgammon, a game he is playing with Walt] Two players, two sides. One is light, one is dark.
***
Hurley: How do you know how to do all that?
Sayid: I was a military communications officer.
Hurley: Oh yeah? You ever see battle?
Sayid: I fought in the Gulf War.
Hurley: No way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the Hundred and Fifth Airborne. What were you, Air Force? Army?
Sayid: The Republican Guard.

[Sawyer has just shot a charging polar bear.]
Kate: Where did that come from?
Sawyer: Probably Bear Village. How the hell do I know?
Kate: Not the bear--the gun.
Sawyer: I got it off one of the bodies.
Sayid: One of the bodies.
Sawyer: Yeah, one of the bodies.
Shannon: People don't carry guns on planes.
Sawyer: They do if they're a U.S. Marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
Kate: How do you know that?
Sawyer: I saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so I took the gun. Thought it might come in handy. Guess what. I just shot a bear!
Kate: So why do you think he's a Marshal?
Sawyer: Because he had a clip-on badge. I took that, too. Thought it was cool.
***
Sayid: If we tell them what we know, we take away their hope... and hope is a very dangerous thing to lose.
Kate: So we lie.
***
Jack: Three days ago we all died. We should all be able to start over.
***
Sawyer: You're just not looking at the big picture, Doc. You're still back in civilization.
Jack: Yeah? And where are you?
Sawyer: Me? I'm in the wild.
***
Hurley: Was it a dinosaur?
Jack: It wasn't a dinosaur.
Hurley: If you didn't see it, how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?
Jack: Cause dinosaurs are extinct.
Hurley: Oh, yeah, good point.
***
Charlie: So, your, uh... your husband, was he on the flight?
Claire: Oh, no, I'm not married.
Charlie: Oh.
Claire: I know. How modern of me.
Charlie: Well, who needs men, right? Bloody useless.
***
Jack: Everyone who was in the rear of the plane is dead.
Rose: They're probably thinking the same thing about us.
***
Sayid: We can find food. There are plenty of things on this island we can use for sustenance.
Sawyer: And exactly how are we gonna find this sustenance?
[A knife is thrown into the seat next to Sawyer's head, everyone looks at Locke]
Locke: We hunt.
Kate: How did you get that on the plane?
Locke: Checked it.
Jack: You either have very good aim, or very bad aim, Mr...
Michael: Locke. His name is Locke.
Jack: Okay Mr. Locke, what is it that we're hunting?
Locke: We know there are wild boar on the island. Razorbacks by the look of em. The ones that came into the camp last night were piglets, 100, 150 pounds each. Which means that there's a mother nearby. A 250 pound rat, with scimitar like tusks, a surly disposition, who'd love nothing more than to eviscerate anything that comes near it. Boar's usual mode of attack is to circle around and charge from behind so I figure it'll take at least three of us to distract her long enough for me to flank one of the piglets, pin it and slit its throat.
Sawyer: And you gave him his knife back?
***
Jack: [To Sawyer about Locke's hunting] Well if you've gotta better idea?
Sawyer: Better than the three of us wandering into the magic forest to bag a hunk of ham with nothing but little bitty hunting knife? Hell no it's the best idea I ever heard. [Locke reveals his suitcase full of hunting knives.]
Hurley: Who is this guy?
***
Jack: We don't have time to sort out everybody's God.
Charlie: Really? Last I heard we were positively made of time.
***
Shannon: The ocean's full of fish.
Boone: Hate to break it to you...the ocean's not gonna take your gold card.
***
Locke: Hey, hey! Don't you walk away from me! You don't know who you're dealing with! Don't ever tell me what I can't do, ever! This is destiny. This is destiny. This is my destiny. This is -- I'm supposed to do this dammit! Don't tell me what I can't do. DON'T TELL ME WHAT I CAN'T...
***
Locke: But I've looked into the eye of this island, and what I saw... was beautiful.
...
Locke: I'm not a big believer in... magic. But this place is different. It's special. The others don't wanna talk about it because it scares them, but we all know it, we all feel it.
***
Jack: I can't.
Locke: Why can't you?
Jack: Because I'm not a leader.
Locke: Yet they all treat you like one.
Jack: I don't know how to help them. I'll fail. I don't have what it takes.
Locke: A Leader can't lead unless He knows where He's going.
***
Jack: It's been six days, and we're all still waiting. Waiting for someone to come. But what if they don't? We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. A woman died this morning just going for a swim. He tried to save her and now you're about to crucify him. We can't do this. Every man for himself is not going to work. It's time to start organizing. We need to figure out how we're going to survive here. Now I found water. Freshwater, up in the valley. I'll take a group up there at first daylight. If you don't want to come then find another way to contribute! Last week most of us were strangers. But we're all here now. And God knows how long we're going to be here. But if we can't live together—we're gonna die alone.
***
Kate: It's just that you... and the tattoos... don't add up. Were you one of those hardcore spinal surgeons or something?
Jack: That's me. Hardcore.
Charlie: If you two are done verbally copulating, we should get a move on.
***
Locke: Pull yourself together, son.
Charlie: It wouldn't be an irrational fear of bees if I could just pull myself together, would it?
***
Kate: [About her T-shirt] It was, uh, it was full of bees.
Charlie: I'd have thought C's, actually.
***
Charlie: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been a week since my last confession.
Priest: Go ahead, my son.
Charlie: Last night, I had... relations with a girl I didn't even know.
Priest: I see. Anything else?
Charlie: Yeah. Right after that I had... relations with another girl. Then straight after that, I watched... while they had... relations with... each other.
***
Locke: [Talking to Charlie about a moth cocoon] You see this little hole? This moth's just about to emerge. It's in there right now, struggling. It's digging it's way through the thick hide of the cocoon. Now, I could help it - take my knife, gently widen the opening, and the moth would be free - but it would be too weak to survive. Struggle is nature's way of strengthening it.
***
Jack: [Trying to get Shannon's inhalers] You attacked a kid for trying to help his sick sister.
Sawyer: No, I whooped a thief 'cause he was going through my stuff--
Jack: Yours? What makes it yours?
Sawyer: --which I had to move because everybody wants to help themselves.
Jack: You can just take something out of a suitcase, and that makes it yours?
Sawyer: Look, I don't know what kind of commie share-fest you're running over in cave town, but down here possession's nine-tenths and a man's got a right to protect his property.
Jack: Get up!
Sawyer: Why, you wanna see who's taller?
Jack: I said get up!
***
Sawyer: [to Jack] You've been waiting for this, haven't you? Now you get to be a hero again, 'cause that's what you do. You fix everything up all nice. [to Kate] Time to let go Freckles. We already made out. What else I got to live for? Hey, Jack, there's something you should know. If the tables were turned...I'd watch you die.
***
Boone: [about Shannon's asthma] She's been embarrassed about it since she was a kid. I guess breathing isn't cool.
***
Kate: Are you serious?
Sawyer: Baby, I am tied to a tree in the jungle of mystery. I just got tortured by a damn spinal surgeon and a genuine Iraqi. Of course I'm serious.
***
[Hurley has laid out a golf course.]
Hurley: Welcome to the first and... hopefully last Island Open! It's two holes, for now, three par, and no waiting!
Jack: Hurley, you built... a golf course?
Hurley: Rich idiots fly to tropical islands all the time to whack balls around!
Michael: [incredulous] All the stuff we gotta deal with, man... this is what you've been wasting your time on?"
Hurley: Dudes... listen. Our lives suck! Everyone's nerves are stretched to the max! We're lost on an island, running from boars and monsters... freakin' polar bears!
Michael: Polar bears?
Charlie: You didn't hear about the polar bear?
***
Sayid: You'll find me in the next life, if not in this one.
Rousseau: What?
Sayid: The writing on the back of Nadia's photograph.
***
Jack: This is bad.
Michael: Yeah. I mean, I know what I would do, but... this has gotta be your call.
Jack: All right... give me the 7 iron.
***
Hurley: So, I had an idea. I'm out here looking for some psycho with Scott and Steve, right. And I'm realizing... who the hell are Scott and Steve?
***
Hurley: We just had a little incident in the valley last night.
Shannon: An incident?
Hurley: Yeah. Claire, the pregnant girl, you know her. She, uh, kinda got attacked.
Shannon: What?
Boone: She's okay?
Hurley: Yeah. She's a little shook up.
Shannon: I am so not moving to the rape caves!
***
Charlie: I had this dream once. I'm driving a bus, and my teeth start falling out. My mum is in the back, eating biscuits. Everything smells of bacon. It's weird.
***
Walt: [After winning backgammon] You owe me twenty thousand dollars!
Hurley: Don't worry, you'll get it.
***
Sawyer: Well, well, well. I don't know if you Islams got a concept of karma, but I get the sense this island just served you up a heaping platter of cosmic payback.
Sayid: What do you want?
Sawyer: Dr. Do-Right doesn't trust me with his antibiotics so I gotta hump it up here every day to get my meds. You know, a less magnanimous man than I might just be thinking he could beat the ever-living snot out of you right now without fear of reprisal.
Sayid: You want a shot, take it. But know that I left this camp out of shame for what I did to you. It was never my intention to return.
Sawyer: Sorry, fresh out of sweet forgiveness. If it wasn't your intention to return, then why did you?
***
Sawyer: So, a tribe of evil natives planted a ringer in the camp to kidnap a pregnant girl and a reject from VH-1 has-beens. Yeah, fiendishly clever. And why am I getting the evening news from a six-year-old?
Walt: I'm ten.
Sawyer: Okay, then it must be true.
***
Locke: [to Jack] You be the doctor, let me be the hunter.
***
Boone: Red shirt. You ever watch Star Trek?
Locke: No, not really.
Boone: The crew guys that would go down to the planet with the main guys, the captain and the guy with the pointy ears, they always wore red shirts and they always got killed.
Locke: Yeah?
Boone: Yeah.
Locke: Sounds like a piss poor captain.
***
Sawyer: I was protecting you!
Kate: From what? Southern perverts?
***
Sawyer: [handing over suitcase] Hope you got yourselves some jaws of life back in cave town. That's what it's gonna take to pop this bitch.
***
Sayid: This was a mistake.
Shannon: Yeah. Haven't you heard? I'm completely useless
***
Jack: How're you doing?
Charlie: How am I doing? With week two of heroin withdrawal? Or how am I doing with Claire being abducted by the freak who tried to kill me?
Jack: I gave you aspirin for the heroin withdrawal.
***
Hurley: [to Jin] Are you sure you don't speak English? There's a rumor that you do... Your wife's hot!
[Jin looks bewildered]
***
Jack: What do you think his story is?
Charlie: Who, Locke? Guy's a freak of nature. Highly disturbed. Chances are he probably killed all his mates at the post office the day his mum forgot to put a cookie in this lunch tin. That was my first impression anyway. Then he saved my life.
Jack: Then you trust him?
Charlie: Trust him? No offense, mate, but if there was one person on this island that I would put my absolute faith in to save us all, it would be John Locke.
***
Jack: What is that?
Charlie: Claire's diary.
Sayid: You read her diary?
Charlie: Yeah, I know. I'm bloody scum.
***
Hurley: We're having another tournament for the last of the deodorant sticks.
***
Walt: [after throwing knife at tree] Man! I suck!
***
Sawyer: Good literature is kinda scarce around here.
***
Charlie: [to Sawyer] You hit like a ponc
