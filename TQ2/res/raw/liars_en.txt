Is that why you killed her? ‘Cause she seen your home movies? …Do you want some popcorn with that?  
***
Dear Mommy, I went to the woods to trap a killer.
***
Wren: You probably have a fluid build-up in your bursa sack.
Spencer: You probably say that to all the girls.
***
Fool me once shame on you, fool my best friend and you’re dead freakin meat! 
***
Those guys have a way of adding 2 & 2 & coming up with 5
***
Melissa: I was hoping you'd be happy for me.
Spencer: Well, you know what they say about hope. It breeds eternal misery.
***
Emily: Poor Ali.
Hanna: Can you believe what a scene this is?
Aria: Alison would've loved it.
Spencer: Popular in life and death.	
***
Aria: I heard the cops took Hanna down to the police station today.
Spencer: You don't think she'd ever tell about--
Hanna: The Jenna thing? We made a promise...
***
Poor Spencer. Always wants Melissa's boyfriends. But, remember if you kiss, I tell. --A
***
Maya: They found your friend...
Emily: I knew she'd come back. Is she inside--
Maya: Emily... They found Alison's body...
***
Emily: If a Hastings has a shot, she takes a shot.
Maya: Is that a drinking game?
Spencer: Yeah, it should be.
***
Maya: Yup, new girl moved in to dead girl's house... I can't believe I just said that...
Spencer: I can't believe you just said that, either...
***
Maya: I think Brad Pitt and I are missing the same sensitivity chip.
***
Emily: Maybe I'm not the person everyone thinks I am.
Hanna: Who is?
***
Did you get a goodnight kiss? Here's one from me. XO --A
***
Spencer: It's probably just a rabbit.
Hanna: Hello?
Spencer: It's a rabbit, Hanna. It's not gonna answer you.
***
Jenna: Whisper, whisper, whisper. It's almost like Alison is still here.
***
Spencer: I made some pasta if you're hungry.
Melissa: I'm not eating pasta. I don't wanna be depressed AND fat.
***
Spencer: I spy with my little eye something that begins with F.
Hanna: Hey Mr. Fitz!
Spencer: Looking good Mr. Fitz! Now, there are teachers you don't wanna see on a bike, and teachers that you do wanna see on a bike.
Hanna: I would not wanna see Mr. Glory on a bike.
***
Spencer: (about Toby) Maybe he took a break from sitting on his porch and pulling the heads off of squirrels.
***
Hanna: If you're gonna cheat, you might as well do it with someone who deep conditions her hair occasionally.
Spencer: Here. Put something in your mouth besides your foot.
***
Maya: (to Emily) I care about you, so I'll wait. You don't need to say anything. You just need to know that.
***
Wren: (to Spencer) I was telling the truth- I wish I'd met you first.
***
Toby: Notice how much we keep saying "sorry" to each other.
Emily: Sorry.
***
Wren: Your face is very fair.
Spencer: How about some black coffee?
Wren: I've been drinking scotch. I'd rather not mix my beverages.
***
Lucky you, Aria! Most girls have to do their homework, you get to do the teacher. --A
***
Lions and tigers and bitches, oh my! There's no place like homecoming. See you there --A
***
Aria: How did I just go from wearing mom jeans to being Samantha Ronson?
***
Spencer: What are you gonna do instead?
Aria: I'll just read these, then inhale a gallon of Chunky Monkey.
***
Maya: Dance music isn't really my thing. I'm not really gaga for Gaga.
***
Mona: If we start slipping up, you and I will be right back at the bottom again.
Hanna: Yeah, well, I feel like I lost a few things on the way up.
***
Spencer: Where's Alex?
Melissa: He left.
Spencer: What?
Melissa: He left. Do you need me to tweet it to you?
***
Lucas: I didn't mean to invade your personal... skin.
Hanna: It's okay. The leprosy cleared up.
***
Spencer: You taking something for the pain?
Emily: Yeah, but nothing that dulls my mother.
***
Spencer: The devil has a name and it's Toby.
Hanna: I really can't afford to take more field trips to the precinct.
***
Spencer: You stole sunglasses? From who?
Hanna: Not from a person, from a store! God, I have some class!
***
Aria: (to her dad) Are you moving out? Just tell me now, I don't wanna find out when I'm setting the table.
***
Sean: (to Hanna after her cell phone rings) Go ahead, answer it. I'm sure it's someone who pulls rank over me.
***
Hanna: (to Mona) I think you're the one who needs a trip to Oz. See if the Wizard can find you a heart.
***
Aria: Where are you going?
Emily: To the restroom. But if you guys don't believe me, we can all try to squeeze into one stall.
***
Mona: (to Lucas) You can go now. This beauty doesn't need a beast.
***
Aria: I'm not looking for anyone more than a friend.
Hanna: Why? I mean, don't you already have enough on Facebook?
***
Hanna: Spencer, you do not need to know any more big words. You're already scary enough to anyone under 50.
Spencer: I am not scary! ... (To Aria) Am I scary?
Aria: ... A little.
***
Define desertion. Seems like you're about to lose Emily. Who's next? --A
***
Aria: Are you sure you gonna be okay?
Hanna: Aria, I went to fat camp for five summers. I can handle some woods.
***
Toby: I spent a year in reform school. I've got friends in all the wrong places, and misery loves company.
***
Spencer: You're as in the dark as Jenna, looking for me in all the wrong places. --A
Emily: Well, if this is the wrong place then what is the right place?
***
Emily: Well, whose car was it?
Aria: ... Ezra Fitz...
Spencer: Mr. Fitz?
Emily: Aria?
Spencer: Hanna...?
***
Aria: (about bumper sticker on Hanna's leg) Next time try something mellower, like "Save the Planet."
Spencer: Sorry, but there were not a lot of choices okay? It was either Humpty Dumpty or "Jesus is coming, look busy."
***
Lucas: Yeah, I'm kinda off studying. This semester I'm planning on going from honor roll to toilet bowl.
***
Aria: A saved my relationship...
Hanna: Yeah, well A tried to kill me.
***
Job description: Heartbreaker. $200 for every dance with Lucas. --A
***
Emily: (About Paige McCullers) She made a comment about me being gay. Spencer: I will destroy her.
***
Hanna: Go Emily!
Aria: She's not swimming yet...
***
Aria: (To Hanna) Why are we sitting with Caleb?
Hanna: Why not?
Spencer: Hanna, I like stray dogs too, but sometimes they bite.
Hanna: Well, don't worry, okay? This dog's has it's shots.
***
Spencer: I think someone framing you.
Toby: What made you change your mind?
Spencer: I think someone may be trying to do the same thing to me.
***
Caleb: Remind me again, which one's Bridgett?
Hanna: Bridgett is the one drinking from her purse.
***
Hanna: (To Aria) I don't like what knowing what I'm capable of.
***
Spencer: I'm sorry last night was a bust--
Toby: It wasn't a complete bust... Plus, it was kinda fun to kick your ass in Scrabble.
***
Hanna: Why isn't she wearing shoes?
Spencer: So she can look small enough to play an 8 year old...
***
Jenna: I find evil so... Inspiring.
Mr. Fitz: Uh... Inspiring?
***
Spencer: (To Hanna) You didn't read the entire play? (Looks at Aria)
Aria: Hey, don't look at me, I'm just here to make her look taller.
***
Hanna: (To Aria about Ezra) Is that the tie you bought him?
Aria: Stop.
***
Alison: Note to self: Don't drink and dive.
***
Alison: The bolder the move, the less anyone questions it.
***
Spencer: I feel like whole parts of my brain have shut down... I used to like Alegebra-- or a least I understood it... And now it's a mess.
Emily: Well, it can get really abstract.
Spencer: Yeah, but that's I liked about it. X's, Y's, Z's-- none of it real. And I could deal with that. Just... Isolate the X factor. And now I feel like I'm the X factor...
***
Emily: Why an owl?
Hanna: It's symbolic.
Emily: Of.. what?
Hanna: Of our first night together. We... Heard owls.
Aria: Swooping down to carry off their prey?
***
Toby: Do me a favor.
Spencer: Anything.
Toby: If you ever think about running away again... Call me first.
***
Ezra: Are you gonna torture me because I gave her the ring instead of you? Seriously, Aria, it wasn't even a karat!
***
Em! You definitely have a type: Love me. Lie for me. --A
***
Hanna: You're not going to be mad at me forever are you?
Lucas: Probably.
***
Caleb: Why are you doing this?
Lucas: Because Hanna has the right to be happy.
***
Aria: Did you really leave your mom a note?
Hanna: Yeah, "Dear Mommy, I went to the woods to trap a killer."
***
Aria:It's not from Spencer, it's from A... It's for all of us: "Buckle up, bitches nothing is as it seems." --A
