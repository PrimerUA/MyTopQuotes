Revenge is a dish best served with my d*ck.

I probably won’t go down in history, but I will go down on your sister.
***
Rehab is for Quitters.
***
You can’t snort a line of coke off a woman’s ass and not wonder about her hopes and dreams… it’s not gentlemanly.
***
People… they don’t write anymore – they blog. Instead of talking, they text, no punctuation, no grammar: LOL this and LMFAO that. You know, it just seems to me it’s just a bunch of stupid people pseudo-communicating with a bunch of other stupid people in a proto-language that resembles more what cavemen used to speak than the King’s English.
***
Your assistant makes me want to touch myself in a bad place.
***
I know that look. That’s the look that makes me want to shrivel my testies.
***
I don’t just say shit. I mean, I do talk a lot of shit, but I generally mean what I say and I say what I mean.
***
Are you sexually harassing me right now? Because if you are, I think I’m gonna have to report you. For giving me a serious boner.
***
I can’t teach you how to write, and anybody who says they can is full of sh*t.
***
You really have to want to quit. You gotta hit rock bottom.
***
Hate the game, not the playa.
***
What? I’m the asshole. Just because I say what’s on everybody’s mind?
***
Integrity, that’s a fine quality in a mistress.
***
There is no life without love. None worth having, anyway.

Hank Moody: - A morning of awkwardness is far better than a night of loneliness.
***
Daisy: - My vagina looks like downtown baghdad right now.
***
Charlie: - In my advanced middle age I've learned one thing and that's ignorance truly is bliss.
Marcy: - Oh God damnit, it's these hot young skanks with their tight pussies and their perfect tits! It's a f**king epidemic!
Charlie: - That is so true! They can't be stopped, they're marriage killers.
***
Hank Moody: -The older I get the clearer it becomes that you two were the best thing to ever happen to an old fool like me.
***
Charlie: -There's no keeping a secret in this town.
***
Trixie: - One day Hank, you're not going to be pining and I'm not going to be working and sparks are gonna fly.
***
Charlie: - Don't say mother fu-ker like that it makes me miss you.
***
Stu: - Let's do the one where Charlie is still your husband, but he's upstairs in a wheelchair.
***
Becca: - Sometimes I think you wish I stayed some asexual little goth muppet creature forever.
Hank: - You say that like it's a bad thing.
***
Hank: - You know what they say? Whatever doesn't kill us makes us even more annoying.
***
Richard: - I gotta come clean Hank, she's been through too much. No offense.
Hank: - Some taken.
***
Hank: - Come on back to bed. Let's californicate.
***
Karen:- L.A. changes people.
Hank: - Cities don't change people, people don't even change people. We are who we are.
***
Hank: - I can't believe this, we are actually sitting around watching a cop eat doughnuts.
***
Hank: - Innocent until proven diminutive.
***
Karen: - These things hurt, you know? 
***
Becca: - I'm not twelve, you can't bribe me anymore. Well you can, but you have to adjust for lifestyle and inflation.
***
Hank: - Some girls are timid and lack focus, but you, you should be in porn.
***
Charlie: - I made myself a promise and I kept it! My heart and c**k both swell with pride.
***
Samurai: - I don't even know a mother f**ker's real name. I just call him Alfred and he snaps right to it.
***
Karen: - He's like you but awesome.
***
Charlie: - I missed yo black ass!
Hank: - Later Masturbator.
***
Karen: - Why does he love her so much? I mean what is it about her?
Hank: - I don't know. I don't think I've ever known. I think sometimes you get it right the first time and then it defines your life. It becomes who you are.
***
Sasha: - Once you f**ked my mother my vagina pretty much sealed right up.
Hank: - So you're like a Barbi now?
***
Karen: - And the judge? Did you sleep with the judge too? 
 Hank: - No, no, just a little oral and some anal. Its hard to get the robe up.
***
Judge: - You have been found guilty of statutory rape, but the real crime here is not one of moral turpitude. Your true crime is that you seem committed to squandering your natural gifts and wasting what appears to be a rewarding life.
***
Karen: - I thought we were a f**king fairy tale, but if you're careless with something long enough you know it breaks. And that's how I feel, broken, completely and utterly broken.
***
Karen: - I am lucky. I'm lucky to have known you. I'm lucky to have loved you, but I feel it's finally over, which is a kind of relief.
***
Marcy: - You're wise and beautiful you know that? You make us feel old and stupid, and we love you for it.
***
Becca: - You know that I pray sometimes Dad? You know what I pray for the most? That I wake up one day and you've become a total bore.
***
Hank: - Revenge is a dish best served with my d**k.
***
Karen: - I don't know how we got here, but this is where we are.
***
Karen: - Once you were my future, then you were my misery, now you're almost my past.
***
Becca: - Dad do we look like the kind of girls who are into American Idol?
Hank: - No not so much, actually you like girls who would hurt girls who were into American Idol.
***
Hank: - Well here's to difficult daughters.
Julia: - Cheers.
Hank: - And uh here's to mothers who drink with strangers.
Julia: - Cheers, Cheers.
***
Becca: - You know what really scares me? I liked being f**ked up, now more than ever. Is that a kid thing or a family thing?
***
Marci: - It's nice to be with a grown up for once.
Charlie: - I used to be a grown up...once.
***
Eddie: - Agent, get us some whores.
***
Stu: - Work is a cruel mistress.
***
Hank: - How is she? OK?
Karen: - OK? What does that even mean at this point?
Hank: - What do you want from me Karen? Look around, welcome to rock bottom.
***
Sasha: - She's really f**ked up, Hank. I can't wait to play her.
***
Charlie: - I hurt myself.
Marci: - What, you get shampoo in your pee hole again?
***
Hank: - It's true I am kind of retarded, but I'm also kind of amazing.
***
Hank: - Sensible and trusting, that's me in a nutshell.
Abby: - How high are you right now?
Hank: - Significantly.
***
Karen: - Let's go get you a pregnancy test.
Marci: - And some snacks?
***
Heather: - Hey do you want to try it from behind?
Charlie: - Absolutely, that's my favorite.
Heather: - Me Too.
Charlie: - Right? Because it gets your spot right?
Heather: - Right, that yes and because I can multitask. The emails just pile up if you don't get to them right away.
***
Becca: - Yeah I don't laugh as easily as I used to.
Hank: - Don't I know it.
Becca: - Guess things aren't as funny as they used to be.
***
Eddie: - You got me?
Hank: - No, you represent everything I hate, but I do find you highly entertaining, continue please.
***
Hank:-  It doesn't have to be this hard Becca.
Becca: - Shouldn't it be hard? I mean isn't that pretty much what happens after the final straw. It's impossible to make things go back to the way they were.
***
Hank:-  No Charlie you look good. Like a baby. Like a big sexy baby.
Charlie: - Thank you. 
***
Hank: - I refuse to be number twelve Charlie.
Charlie: - Oh I wasn't counting the guys
***
Hank: - My adventures in the screen trade have been about as much fun as forced anal.
***
Hank: - A lot can happen in a weekend.
***
Abby: - Start with a shower, you smell like you just walked out of a fisting contest.
***
Mia: - That's the thing about secrets, Hank, they have a funny way of coming out.
***
Charlie: - She's a cocktail waitress with a screenplay. Ok.. an idea for a screen play, but still, I see potential and I just -
Marcy: - Oh please! You see blow job!
***
Becca: - So overall you would recommend the experience of sleeping with your teacher?
***
Charlie: - No matter what they say, bitches don't like it when you f**k other bitches.
Hank: Word.
***
Charlie: - I had my whole life flash before my eyes, really just like a TIVO on fast forward, and you know what? It was really f**king pathetic.
***
Karen: - (To Felicia) You say one more word to me and I will show you where Becca learned to throw down!
***
Charlie: - Like your dream crush now, Marcy?
Marcy: -It's like watching a figure skater fall.
***
Felicia: - That was some very intense and powerful love-making.
 Hank: - Not a big fan of that term: love-making - making love. I prefer boning, stuffing, stupping, banging, porking, boffing - anything, take your pick, just not love-making.
