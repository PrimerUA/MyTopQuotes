Walter: Excuse me Miss, is that lemon Jello?
Nurse: These are urine samples.
Walter: Well in that case, no thank you. I'm more peckish than thirsty.
***
Olivia: If you've lost your mind, now would be the time to tell me!
***
Peter: It's going to be okay.
Olivia: You know, for the first time I don't think it is.
***
Nina: Now I know how it sounds, but I believe shew as activated to power the universe collapse.
Olivia: Lucky me.
***
Walter: Why William? Why would you do this? What can you hope to gain by destroying both universes?
***
September: I must investigate the future and find out what I meant. I hope I get back to you in time.
***
Olivia: At least now we know how you got shot. I've seen you shot before, like this. You came to me, at the opera house. You said in every version of the future, I would have to die.
***
William Bell: The bible tells us God created his universe in seven days. It has taken me considerably longer.
***
Walter: Nina! It was the work of a master, not an imposter. I know the difference!
***
Astrid: Alex?
Walter: I was on a roll.
***
David Robert Jones: I got it wrong. I was the sacrifice. I was the bishop!
***
Walter: Like I said, cortexiphan is regenerative, shouldn't need it though.
***
Walter: Oh! Get a knife. My lemon cake's ready.
 Astrid: Walter, if you were hungry, I could have gotten you something.
 Walter: This is not about food, Alex, this is about Belly! Where's the knife. Please, quickly!
***
Walter: He's alive! I'm telling you, he's alive! I know that Jones' plan was too ingenious, too remarkable, that it had to come from Belly!
***
Peter: So at least we know Jones is in our universe.
***
Walter: May I take a blood sample? The discomfort will only be momentary.
Jessica: That's what all you men say.
Walter: You're very brave.
***
Jessica: What are you?
Walter: I'm human, what are you? Is this some sort of alien invasion? Are you part of a strike?
***
Peter: Three bedrooms and a dog run...
Olivia: Nursery?
Peter: Nursery?
***
Walter: I think I shall miss them, more than I imagined.
***
Lincoln: Remember you said home is where the heart is? This may sound crazy, but I think I found mine.
***
Broyles: Washington has made their decision. They will support whatever we decide in this room.
***
Peter: I've come to the opinion that home is where the heart is.
***
Peter: It's weird to think of never seeing them again. Knowing that they're right there. So close. It's not the kind of thing you forget.
***
Walter: One more thing, have you tried LSD?
***
Lincoln: I find it's best if you just go with it.
***
Peter: Walter, could the connection between our two universes be what's facilitating this psychic link?
Walter: I suppose.
Peter: So what if we severed it?
***
Peter: You did great Walter.
 Walter: He can't even stay in the same room as me.
 Peter: He listened to you. They all did.
***
Walter Bishop: These aren't the droids you're looking for.
***
Etta: Do you know me?
Peter: I don't know how I could. I've been stuck in that amber for over 20 years, you barely look old enough...Henrietta?
Etta: Hi dad.
***
Astrid: William Bell? You just left him there"
Walter: You remember what he did to Olivia. Even you can't be that compassionate.
***
Walter: In that case, a little more focus and a little less pontificating and we might have the job done by now.
***
Walter: I've eaten it once. It's sweeter than you think.
Simon: Feces?
Walter: God no! Brains! And LSD. Love LSD.
***
Walter: What is that monkey feces?
Simon: That, Dr. Bishop, is your brain.
***
Walter: I do hope we're going to the circus.
***
alter: Twenty years? It's no wonder I'm so hungry. Do you have anything to eat?
***
Simon: When I say.
Etta: Really? I was going to go before.
***
Broyles: Widmark. What did you do up there in the future to get yourself such a crap detail?
Widmark: I like animals.
***
Simon: I'll be a toe on a foot in a grave.
***
Walter: Some people swear by hair of the dog, but I prefer nature's sponge, the egg.
***
Walter: Apparently this universe has not discovered memory foam.
Fauxlivia: You know, Walter, you can stay at my place tonight. I have a spare room.
Walter: Wonderful. And I shall refrain from sleeping naked.
Fauxlivia: Good to know.
***
Walter: Domesticated badgers? Really? As pets?
***
Lincoln: You couldn't bring over a casserole, but a severed hand is OK?
***
Walter: On purpose? Anything's possible. Even Santa Claus.
***
Walter: Ah! My escort is here. And by escort, I mean prostitute.
***
Alt-Broyles: I understand, but this level of surveillance involves a lot of red tape. I'll cut through it.
***
Walter: Feel it Peter.
Peter: Oh really, can I?
Walter: He's dead, Peter, you can't hurt him.
Peter: Not really what I was concerned about.
***
Alt-Lincoln: Liv, I've been blown up before. This is nothing.
***
Shapeshifter: There are these people you come across. These bright, bright lights. They drift across life, effortlessly. Unforgettable. I'm not one of them.
***
Fauxlivia: I mean, your team may toil away in secret over there, but over here, you're heroes.
***
Alt-Lincoln: Oh, you mean Mantis.
Lincoln: Seriously? Your superhero is a flying insect?
Fauxlivia: Because nothing says badass like a flying bat?
***
Lincoln: You don't like Tyrone? I think it's a strong middle name.
***
Broyles: If you're 60% of the Olivia Dunham that I knew, then you're still better than 90% of the agents that I've ever worked with. And a Fringe Division with Olivia Dunham is better than a Fringe Division without her.
***
Walter: You mean assuming that creating a human flying porcupine hybrid was not his end game.
***
Walter: I know what you're thinking. Wouldn't it be easier to just eat people?
***
Walter: Agent Lee is infected. We know for sure now!
Peter: And we're excited about that why?
Lincoln: He says I'm going to be fine, by the way.
***
Peter: You're a good guy.
Lincoln: Yeah. I'm a good guy.
***
Peter: Do you want to talk about it or should we just pretend like we already did? Olivia.
Lincoln: She's your Olivia. I get it. I mean I don't really get it, how she could suddenly become this other version of herself.
***
Walter: I like porcupines. It shows that God has a sense of humor!
***
Lincoln: Broyles asked me to take lead till she comes back, I hope you're OK with that.
***
Olivia: You should get that. I think the 70s are calling.
***
Olivia: Why should I expect that because you and I are back together that everything is going to be fine and that the world is going to live up to my every expectation?
***
Broyles: Forty percent of all the information you provided is not correct. Which as far as the tenth floor is concerned means you are not the agent they licensed.
