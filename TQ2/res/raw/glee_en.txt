F:How do we know he's not gonna just get us to do something stupid so his alma mater wins?
J:I don't think I need to do much tricking to get you to do something stupid, Finn.
– Finn and Jesse St. 
***
[To Finn] You kind of sing and dance like a zombie who has to poop.
***
[To Jesse] Maybe you can come on Fondue for Two and judge my cat?
***
W:I just want you to know, you can lean on me right now.
S:Oh William, I wouldn't dare lean on you—so much grease in your hair I'd probably slide right off.
***
I do this thing where I sort of alternate which one of those kids I hate the most. Right now, it's the dancing Asian.
***
[To Rachel] That's sweet. You remember the masculine click of my designer boots.
***
William, I'm devastated, positively horny with grief. As a going-away present, here's a spray bottle of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter; keep the head merkin looking buttery fresh.
***
I would like to graduate high school knowing at least how to make some sort of pate.
***
I traded love for a fourth consecutive national championship. It was a bum deal. For a first, maybe, but not for a fourth.
– Jesse St. 
***
I'd like your feedback as to whether I was brilliant or simply outstanding.
***
[To Artie] You should be ashamed of yourself—you are seriously no fun to interrogate or almost torture.
***
Dude, it's none of YB—Your Business.
– Jesse St. 
***
They must have sensed I'm a lesbian. Do I smell like a golf course?
***
As soon as we get to New York, I'm moving to a lesbian colony. Or Tribeca.
***
Just because I hate everybody doesn't mean they have to hate me too.
***
[To Rachel] Santana told me to never speak alone with you because you'd steal all of my gold.
***
[To Rachel] Do you believe in that thing called karma? Can you explain it to me?
***
[To Will] You know what they say: Those who can't, teach. Turns out maybe you can. Think about that next time you prop your little butt chin on one of those face toilets.
***
Being a ginger has plagued me my entire life. People say I smell like copper. I can get a sunburn indoors at night. According to recent legend, I have no soul.
***
S:Can we all just stop lying about how there aren't any things we would change about ourselves? I mean, I'm sure Sam's been at the doctor's office and rifled through pamphlets on mouth reduction. I'll bet Artie's thought about getting his legs removed since he's not really using them anyways. And I'm definitely sure Tina's looked into an eye de-slanting.
T:That's extraordinarily racist.
S:I'm just keepin' it real.
T:I'm in love with myself and I would never change a thing.
M:Is that why you're wearing blue contacts today, Tina? Self-hatin' Asian.
***
[To Finn] Oh please. You have weird puffy pyramid nipples. They look like they're filled with custard. You could dust them with powdered sugar and serve them as some sort of dessert.
***
Look, maybe Rachel's fine with having an enormous beak. Maybe she needs it to crack hard seeds.
***
I'm a closet lesbian and a judgmental bitch, which means one thing—I have awesome gaydar.
***
[To Karofsky] You're a late in life gay ... Look, I'm not ready to start eating jicama or get a flat top either. Maybe in junior college.
***
The only straight I am's a straight up bitch.
***
Oh, and also, I have razorblades hidden in my hair. Tons, just hidden all up in there.
***
I'm handsome, I'm good-looking, and I'm easy on the eyes. Also, I'm gorgeous.
***
What's that saying: The show's gotta go all over the place, or something?
***
R:Can you define what you mean by neglected?
W:I mean someone whose brilliance isn't appreciated.
R:Oh, so you mean like me.
***
I'm perfectly capable of accessing my pain. I cry every time I sing a solo.
***
[To Brittany and Santana] Well, well. If it isn't Tweedledum and Tweedle Fake Boobs.
***
I have to say, I am very inspired that both of you are showing how celibacy is a viable option for teens who simply aren't ready for teens who are simply not ready for intimacy—or for those who are older and are terrified of the hose monster.
***
K:Coach Sylvester, what are you doing here?
S:Just picking up some coffee. I like my enemas piping hot.
***
I want to be like a Kardashian. I want a TV show, and a fragrance. It'll be called "Zizes," and the slogan will be, "You just got Zized."
***
I'm not interested in any labels, unless it's on something I shoplift.
***
You get tensies for menses.
***
I like you, Lauren. I like wooing you. Next to dropping my afternoon deuce it's my favorite part of the day.
***
I know hickies. I'm a freakin' connoisseur. I can make them into shapes, like balloon animals.
***
How am I supposed to write "Both Sides Now" if I can't even throw a party?
***
It tastes like pink!
***
Your face tastes awesome.
***
I told my mom and I had the flu and she made me a traditional tea out of panda hair
***
Q:There's a fair amount of the pot calling the kettle black right now.
B:That is so racist.
***
[To Rachel] Blaine is the first in a long line of conflicted men that you will date that will turn out to be only the most flaming of homosexuals.
***
I just had a relationship with a guy who turned out to be gay. That is songwriting gold.
***
William, I don't care how cute those children are, if I hear one song from that classic rock outfit Journey, I will start pulling catheters.
***
W:What are you doing tomorrow night? I want to take you somewhere.
S:No no no, no way. Doesn't matter how depressed I am, I will not date a curly.
W:Don't worry, not a date, Sue.
S:Still probably not gonna go.
***
Most teachers think that by cutting class, I might improve my grades.
***
For a brief period, I was a tambourine player for Wilson Phillips.
***
[To Rachel] I have to go get my cross trainers. You want to know why? I am going to be doing some runs.
***
I wore a tank top today because I thought it was summer, and no one ever taught me to read a calendar.
***
W:All right guys, I have one word for you. [Writes "Love" on the board]
B:Is it love? I'm totally gonna graduate now.
***
I've kissed Finn, and can I just say? Not worth a buck. I would, however, pay a hundred dollars to jiggle one of his man-boobs.
***
You guys love me. I keep it real, and I'm hilarious.
***
T:Five minutes ago, you said Mr. Schue belonged in a twelve-step program!
W:Wait, what?
S:You're addicted to vests.
– Tina, Will, and SantanaRead the Recap »
The truth is Santana, you can dish it out but you can't take it. Okay, maybe you're right. Maybe I am destined to play the title role in the Broadway musical version of Willow, but the only job you're gonna have is working on a pole!
***
[Of Artie] That's my man and his legs don't work!
***
Hello, Lauren. You are a beautiful person. Now get out of my way please, afore's I ends you.
***
I am from a part of town called Lima Heights Adjacent. You know where that is, Poppin' Fresh? It's on the Wrong. Side. Of the Tracks.
***
Ugh, I'll just marry an NFL player. They're super reliable.
***
That's weird—Quinn's wearing her Queen Bitch smirk, and Finn only wears that gassy infant look when he feels guilty about something. Holy sweet hell, they're fooling around! I know what cheating looks like—I do it all the time.
***
Blaine and I love football. Well, Blaine loves football. I love scarves.
***
W:[Explaining football to Rachel] When they tackle you, it hurts.
P:Yeah, and not in the good Mellencamp way.
***
Q:I'm torn.
B:I'm not. I'm Brittany.
***
I don't want to die yet. At least not until One Tree Hill gets canceled...
***
S:Brittany, please remind me of how I singlehandedly put cheerleading on the map.
B:In 1979 you directed a made for TV movie about the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders called...The Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders.
***
W:Do you trust me?
B:You're not gonna try to kiss me again, are you?
***
The roads to the North Pole are getting treacherous. And remember, even the smallest envelope is heavy for an elf.
***
W:I thought you hated the holidays.
S:No, I just hate you.
***
[Handing Will an electric shaver] I thought you might want to put all of us out of our misery and shave off that Chia pet.
***
Camouflage is the only thing that kept me from getting court marshalled after that My Lai misunderstanding.
***
I can't believe six different people got Sue Shake Weights.
***
[To Will] So what brings you here? Are you looking to teach at a place where pencils aren't used as weapons?
***
Remember when I told you I was bringing all those science books to an exorcist? Well, that's what we call a diversion.
***
Becky, go into the glove box of my car and get me tear gas. Then get me Gloria Allred.
***
Early's late if you make tomorrow yesterday.
***
I prayed to God and told him if I ever got out, I'd start being nicer. Then I changed it to just Jews.
***
[To Rachel] You used to be just sort of unlikeable, but now I pretty much feel like punching you every time you talk.
***
[To Finn and Rachel] Why don't you sing about it? Aren't there some songs about betrayal? I'm pretty sure there are some Eagles songs ...
***
R:Do you ever fantasize about your own funeral?
K:No ...
R:I do.
***
Mr. Schue, we heard the news about Emma getting married to the finest dentist alive.
***
If we lose, we should throw possums.
***
I'm thinking a russet and cognac theme. Those are colors, Finn.
***
... which is why I prefer to think of the homeless as outdoorsy.
***
[To Rachel] You're so on my list, dwarf.
***
S:I'm dating Puckerman.
Q:No, you're getting naked with Puckerman.
***
I miss my office, this room smells weird. I can't shake the feeling I'm inhaling a lot of dead skin.
***
W:When I'm sick, there's only one thing that makes me feel better...
A:Gin and juuuuuuice!
***
H:Hi, I'm Holly Holliday.
T:Are you a porn star or a drag queen?
***
You annoy me William. You make the underflaps of my breasts burn, like when I used to rub poison sumac on them.
***
[To Will] I suggest you sell yourself on Craigslist under the heading of "Men Seeking Men With Butt Chins."
***
Do you know what this is? It's broccoli. When I showed this to Brittany earlier, she began to whimper, thinking I had cut down a small tree where a family of gummi bears used to live.
***
You smell homeless, Brett. Homeless.
***
I have a bruise on my right buttock from your game of gangsta rap musical chairs.
***
I gotta be honest, Will, a lot of it's the hair thing. I'm tempted right now to sell your scalp on the black market as the tiniest of shearling coats for only the most fashionable of babies.
***
S:You should be our nation's president.
P:Maybe.
***
[To Will] To my right, you will see a confetti cannon. To my left, another. Do you know what that means, Will? We got Beiste fired. And my budget is restored. Bwahahahahahha!
***
I believe I just said that, Annie Sullivan. Want me to sign it into your palm?
***
W:Look, I'm not tossing the baby out with the bath water here.
B:I've totally done that.
***
There's no way I'm going back to juvie. There's no chicks and no kosher meal options up in that place.
***
You crap on my leg, I'll cut it off.
***
You really can't put a dollar amount on the combination of talent plus fear.
***
Dude, I don't pay for food. It's my thing, yo.
***
K:What are you going as for Halloween?
B:A peanut allergy.
***
Halloween is fast approaching: the day when parents encourage little boys to dress like little girls and little girls to dress like whores.
***
[To Rachel] I'd like to preserve you. In a jar. In my basement.
***
Earlier today Artie asked if he could make an omelette with the enormous ostrich eggs I was smuggling in my bra.
***
Ain't no carbo in sexy.
***
I shoulda known: People who dress like librarians? All sex addicts.
***
Are you ready for a chilling statistic? 70% of all the teeth in this school are wooden.
***
W:What's a duet?
B:A blanket.
***
[To Brittany] I'm not making out with you because I'm in love with you. I'm making out with you because Puck's been in the slammer for 24 hours and I'm like a lizard: if I don't have something warm beneath me I can't digest my food.
***
How can you do a duet with yourself? That's like, vocal masturbation, or something.
***
Oh wow. He has no game.
***
K:No straight boy has hair like Linda Evangelista circa 1993.
M:You're crazy circa 2010.
***
Just so you know, I have custom bibs for me and Mercedes. You know why? Cause we's—be's goin'—to Breadstix.
***
So. Freakin'. Charming.
***
Until you find someone as open and brave as you, you're going to have to get used to going it alone.
***
Look, I don't mean to be a bitch—well, actually, I do.
***
I'm not the most religious guy—I sort of worship Clapton and Ochocinco.
***
P:Oh my God, he's coming out.
F:Well yes there is a man who's come into my life recently. And that man is Jesus Christ.
P:That's way worse.
***
Whenever I pray, I fall asleep.
***
K:You can't prove that there isn't a magic teapot floating around on the dark side of the moon with a dwarf inside that reads romance novels and shoots lightning out of its boobs, but it seems pretty unlikely, doesn't it?
B:God's an evil dwarf?
***
F:Children should be allowed to profess whatever faith they choose.
S:At the BET Awards, but not at school.
***
This country is not a monarchy, William. Trust me, I've tried.
***
[To Kurt] I'm sorry for what you're goin' through, lady. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I guess I don't have to: I think Mary Lou Retton's like, an orphan or something.
***
I know sometimes I mess around with you guys for fun. I admit it; it aids digestion.
***
[To Emma] I realize you're only half orangutan, but I'm still very allergic to your lustrous ginger mane.
***
B:I don't want to do Britney.
K:Why no Britney, Brittany?
B:Because my name is also Britney Spears. My middle name is Susan. My last name is Pierce. That makes me Brittany S. Pierce—Britney Spears. I've lived my entire life in Britney Spears's shadow and I'll never be as talented or as famous. I hope you'll all respect that I want glee club to remain a place where I, Brittany S. Pierce, can escape the torment of Britney Spears.
***
The other day he made me buy the green grapes and the red grapes at the market, and then we just mixed them in the bowl and just ate them. It was madness, sheer madness!
***
[To Emma] Oh I love that look of instant panic every time I try to change your routine! Adorable!
***
W:Kids can't sing without teeth, right?
C:No. They wouldn't be singing, they'd be gumming! Ma ma ma ma!
***
I don't brush my teeth. I rinse my mouth out with soda after I eat. I was pretty sure Dr. Pepper was a dentist.
***
Please don't pull all my teeth. When I smile, I'll look like an adult baby but with boobs.
***
C:I'm gonna put you on anaesthesia. You won't feel a thing.
B:Like roofies?
C:Yeah totally.
***
S:[To Rachel] Hey, dwarf. Anyone ever tell you you dress like one of the bait girls on To Catch a Predator?
B:Also, I'm more talented than you.
***
I would just like to say that from now on, I demand to have every solo in glee club. When I had my teeth cleaned, I had the most amazing Britney fantasy. I sing and dance better than her. It made me realize what a powerful woman I truly am. I'm more talented than all of you; I see that clearly now. It's Brittany. Bitch.
***
I look forward to the day the paparazzi provokes me and I attack them.
***
It's not like when I went all sad clown hooker and put on that Grease catsuit.
***
Well, Rachel, congratulations. Normally you dress like the fantasy of a Japanese businessman with a very dark, specific fetish, but I actually dig this look. Yay!
***
Every day, Tina and Mike's Asian fusion grows stronger.
***
Let's face it, Finn. The only way this relationship is going to work is if we're both losers.
***
[To Will] Oh wow, you're all dressed up. You look like a cast member of Kids Incorporated.
***
Not sure if you heard William, but my spinal column was ruptured in a sex riot
***
W:Sue, you pulled the alarm. Everything was going fine.
S:You know, William, that's what one Hubert Humphrey said back in 1968 at the start of the Democratic National Convention. But then hippies put acid in everyone's bourbon, and when an updraft revealed Lady Bird Johnson's tramp stamp and tattoos above her ovaries, Mayor Richard J. Daley became so incensed with sexual rage that he punched his own wife in the face and spent the next hour screaming, "Sex party!" into the microphones of all three major networks.
W:Okay, I'm pretty sure none of that actually happened.
***
I'm gonna take your house, your car, your extensive collection of vests. I mean, seriously, Will—you wear more vests than the cast of Blossom.
***
U.S. History. Crap, I forgot I was taking that.
***
F:Rachel’s what you’d call a controllist.
R:I’m controlling. Controllist isn’t a word.
***
J:How do you respond to a recent post on my blog saying your glee club song selections sound like they come from a drag queen’s iPod?
W:Well I try to do something for everybody—25% show tunes, 25% hip hop, 25% classic rock....
J:100% gay.
***
People thought I went on vacation, but actually I spent the summer lost in the sewers.
***
My eyes are up here, Jew-fro.
***
I like being friends with you Will. It's fun! You make trying to destroy glee club so easy. Know why? Cause you're doin' such a bang-up job of it yourself!
***
B:You’re all coffee and no omelette.
S:That doesn’t make any sense.
***
That’s a steer with six teats and no oinks!
***
P:Dude, your mouth is huge. How many tennis balls can you fit in there?
S:I don’t know. I’ve never had any balls in my mouth. Have you?
***
M:So is that a...men’s sweater?
K:Fashion has no gender.
***
Tina, Mike, what if Sunshine can dance? Then your contributions to glee club will be even more insignificant than they are now.
***
Kiss my ass, Josh Groban. I’m an internationally ranked cheerleading coach.
***
Brunettes have no place in show business.
– Olivia Newton-JohnRead the Recap »
To be honest, Will, I’m having a really difficult time hearing anything you say today, because your hair looks like a briar patch. I keep expecting racist, animated Disney characters to pop up and sing songs about living on the bayou.
***
That young terrorist went on to be the first gay president of the United States: Abraham Lincoln.
***
True love always springs from true hate.
***
I thought Jews were supposed to be smart?
***
Revenge. Fear. The merciless affliction of pain. These are my kingdoms.
***
Barbra? I could do it in my sleep.
***
I thought the boys’ Kiss number was good, although the lyrics did leave something to be desired.
***
What’s up with this Gaga dude? He just, like, dresses weird, right? Like Bowie?
***
I’m proud to be different. It’s the best thing about me.
***
I sound like someone put tap shoes on a horse and shot it.
***
What’s the matter, Schuester? Cat got your talent?
***
Honestly, the only students that come and see me on a scheduled weekly basis are ones that have been diagnosed with certain psychological disorders, like a certain junior female that eats her own hair.
***
We need to do a real investigation. Like CSI real.
***
Our home-ec program teaches practical skills, like food-service preparation. You can’t feed a child sheet music, Will. I mean, I suppose you can for a while, but they’d be dead in a month.
***
Now I’m such a steaming mug of hot chocolate that one of the studliest guys in school wants to use me to harvest some mojo.
***
So you like show tunes: Doesn’t mean you’re gay, it just means you’re awful.
***
I’m a sex shark. If I stop moving, I die.
***
We’re as menacing as Muppet Babies.
***
Why does everyone assume I’m angry all the time? It’s called being sassy, Mr. Schue.
***
Maybe if we seem more dangerous, people will stop flushing my glasses down the toilet.
***
I’m a delinquent, sure. I like setting things on fire and beating up people I don’t know. I own that. But I’m not a liar.
***
On assembly days, I arrange for the rest of the school to be fumigated, leaving the gymnasium the only place with breathable air.
***
What I want is for you to appreciate how hard it is for me to watch you bond with the son you’ve always wanted.
***
I finally realized my lifelong ambition of being a mistress to an incredibly wealthy strip-mall tycoon.
***
Mr. Schue, is [Jesse] your son?
***
My growing feminism will cut you in half like a righteous blade of equality.
***
I need to take control of myself and my body, just like Madonna, which is why I'm planning on doing the nasty with you tonight at your place.
***
Mercedes is black, I’m gay. We make culture.
***
No chick intimidates Puckzilla.
***
When I pulled my hamstring, I went to a misogynist.
***
It’s like Madonna once said: I’m tough, I’m ambitious, and I know what I want. If that makes me a bitch, okay. I’m pretty sure she stole that line from one Sue Sylvester.
***
[Sniffs] Oh, hey William. I thought I smelled cookies wafting from the ovens of the little elves who live in your hair.
***
I’m engorged with venom and triumph.
***
Did you know dolphins are just gay sharks?
***
I like to give impromptu concerts for the homeless. It’s good to give back.
***
I’m getting out of Ohio soon. I’ve got a full ride to a little school called the University of California, Los Angeles. Maybe you’ve heard of it. It’s in Los Angeles.
***
I’m gonna bring some Asian cookery to rub your head with, 'cause right now you’ve got enough product in your hair to season a wok.
***
W:Now that you're back, let's bury the hatchet.
S:I won't be burying any hatchets, William, unless I happen to get a clear shot to your groin.
***
Those spotlights in the auditorium don’t run on dreams. Our electricity consumption is up two percent.
***
Get ready for the ride of your life, Will Schuester. You’re about to board the Sue Sylvester express. Destination? Horror.
***
Bring it on, William. I am reasonably confident that you’ll be adding revenge to the long list of things you’re no good at. Right next to being married, running a high-school glee club, and finding a hairstyle that doesn’t make you look like a lesbian.
***
We’ve got a problem. They’re doing all of our numbers, the kids are completely freaking out, Artie keeps ramming himself into the wall, and I’m pretty sure Jacob Ben Israel just wet himself.
***
What happened to the white guy with the jheri curl?
***
Perhaps I could improvise some of my Def Poetry Jams.
***
Does this have to happen tonight? I have my fight club.
***
I say we lock Rachel up until after sectionals. I volunteer my basement.
***
Sometimes people have to deal with a little adversity. I learned that at glee club.
***
There's a stack of mattresses in the choir room piled as high as the empty hair gel bottles in the dumpster outside your apartment.
***
All I want is one day a year where I’m not visually assaulted by uglies and fatties. Seriously, Ohio, these retinas need a day off. So here’s the dream: Friday after Christmas, which I have off, if you’re hideous, stay at home.
***
Ken has a lot of flaws. He has 74 flaws as of yesterday. But you know what? He’s not vindictive.
***
This year I told them to yank out the tear ducts. Wasn’t using them.
***
I’m going to say this as nice as possible, but you look like a sad-clown hooker.
***
So hairography works best when you pretend like you’re getting tasered. Just move your head around like you’re spazzing and stuff.
***
I admit, I like a challenge as much as the next guy. But Rachel somehow manages to dress like a grandmother and a toddler at the same time.
***
If you can’t take Mohammad to the mountain, then you got to get Mohammad to bring the mountain down to his house. Mohammad’s house...or wherever he’s staying.
***
Let me tell a few things I learned from two years of intense psychotherapy and an esophagus transplant. Lesson No. 1: You and Schue won’t work.
***
I don’t know why I find his stupidity charming. I mean, he’s cheating off a girl who thinks the square root of four is rainbows.
***
I could totally sing this with Finn. But screw him if he thinks he’s taking the Diana Ross part.
***
I want to be very clear: I still have the use of my penis.
***
As soon as a cheerleader rolls herself out onto the field in a wheelchair, she becomes decidedly less effective at cheering people up.
***
I’m really nervous about the diva-off tomorrow.
***
Why do we have to go all vanilla on this song? What we need is my chocolate thunder.
***
I don’t think one decision makes your life. Unless you invent some zombie virus or something.
***
How may I help you, kids? Too many friends on MySpace?
***
When I woke up, I knew it was more than a dream. It was a message from God. Rachel was a hot Jew and the good Lord wanted me to get into her pants.
***
When my Mom applied to college, she put being popular as her main extracurricular activity. And she got into Arizona State.
***
The slushie war has commenced.
***
You’re all minorities. ‘Cause you’re in glee club.
***
Fellow Glee clubbers, it would be an honor to show you how a real storm-out is done. I encourage you to follow my lead.
***
It’s sad enough that my Sue’s Kids are living in squalor and probably on food stamps, but for you to drag them in here and bore them to death? I won’t stand for it.
***
I came up with the best baby name of all time: Drizzle.
***
I don’t trust a man with curly hair. I can’t help picturing small birds laying sulfurous eggs in there and I find it disgusting.
***
Glee is supposed to be about what’s inside your heart, not what’s coursing through your veins.
***
Do yourself a favor, honey. Marry Ken Tanaka. Oh sure, he’s dumb like sand and his fondue pot of nationalities is going to open up your kids to a host of genetic diseases. But he’s kind. And he’s generous. And he’s available.
***
I can’t get Rachel out of my head. She kind of freaks me out in a Swimfan kind of way, but she can really sing, and her body is smoking—if you’re not really into boobs.
***
I never wanted kids. Don’t have the time, don’t have the uterus.
***
Glee club. Every time I try to destroy that clutch of scab-eating mouth breathers, it only comes back stronger, like some sort of sexually ambiguous horror-movie villain.
***
Sober? I’m rolling on a fistful of horse tranquillizers. I can’t feel my lips.
***
Do you have any NyQuil? I need a little pick-me-up.
***
A few years ago, I started an online flirtation with a high-school flame, Andy. Things got weird and I called it off. And two months later...Versace was dead. Dead.
***
Quid pro quo, Rachel. If you want a good review, show me your over-the-shoulder boulder holder.
***
Being a part of the glee club and football has really showed that I can be anything. And what I am is…I’m gay.
***
I had sex with you because you got me drunk on wine coolers and I felt fat that day. But it was a mistake. You’re a Lima loser and you’ll always be a Lima loser.
