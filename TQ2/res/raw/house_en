House: - People choose the paths that grant them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort.
***
Foreman: - Isn't treating patients why we became doctors?
House: - No, treating illnesses is why we became doctors. Treating patients is what makes most doctors miserable.
***
House: See that, they all assume I'm a patient because of the cane.
Wilson: Then why don't you put on a white coat like the rest of us?
House: Then they'll think I'm a doctor.
***
Foreman: Oh, Cameron, I need you for a couple of hours.
Cameron: What's up?
Foreman: When you break into someone's house, it's always  better to have a white chick with you.
***
House [to Wilson]: I'm dead. How do you want to spend your last five months?
***
House: He's happy.
Amber: He's dead.
***
House: I know you'll do the honest thing. You'll lie.
***
House [to Foreman]: From what I hear, nothing black is tiny. Except your penis.
***
Wilson: Just dinner?
House: That depends on how much you have to drink.
***
Adams: He just wants to die with a little dignity.
House: There's no such thing.
***
House: I need to turn Wilson from a terminal idiot to an interminable pain in the ass.
***
House: Come here so I can talk you out of it?
Chase: Came to say thank you. 
House: It's been fun.
Chase: Fun?
House: Sounded pithier than 'we have shared a variety of situations.'
***
Wilson: I'm sorry. I wasn't familiar with hooker protocol.
***
House: If we had a phone, we could have found a place a lot less charming.
***
Wilson: Tomorrow I'm leaving work behind to chase my boyhood crush.
House: The years have not been kind to David Cassidy.
***
Wilson: I've taken a meaningful vow to lead a less meaningful life
***
Dominika: How can you believe in dark matter, but not in dark spirits?
***
Chase: I'm looking at her.
Park: Um, I'm looking at him.
House: Good. Now lick your lips.
***
Wilson: My watch must have stopped. Must be a quarter to never.
***
House: Relax. I'm a doctor. Your spectacular breasts mean nothing to me.
***
House: For a moment I thought you were uncomfortable with Chase because you had a nocturnal Australian.
***
Wilson: You are a horrible person.
House: All I need is to break up one marriage. You broke up three of your own. You're like the Stephen Hawking of killing relationships.
***
Taub: Ohhhh. A metaphor. What you didn't foresee is that I actually do have a sex doll.
***
Adams: You can juggle. I fail to see how this would benefit you.
House: What if I'm busy?
***
House: Thank you, Butterscotch. Is that a family name?
***
House: 35 year old male who cries blood and is not Vampire Bill. Go!
***
House: Short man equals bullied child.
Taub: I was never bullied.
Dr. Adams: Until now.
***
Chase: Cheerleaders are the best part of basketball. Without them, you just have...basketball.
***
Wilson: Oh, sand art! I used to love this stuff!
House: He's bitter, not mentally handicapped.
***
Dr. House: I don't ask why patients lie. I just assume they all do. 
***
Dr. House: No, there is not a thin line between love and hate. There is, in fact, a Great Wall of China with armed sentries posted every twenty feet between love and hate.
***
Dr. House: I've been a doctor for years. Why do I have to keep assuring people I know what I'm doing?
***
Dr. House: Less money is made by biochemists working on a cure for cancer than by their colleagues struggling valiantly to find ways to hide steroid use. 
***
Dr. Chase: No lesions, no aneurysms. Ironically, the mind of a killer looks completely normal. 
***
Dr. Cameron: I have fun. 
Dr. Chase: Yeah, she's got some scheduled for February. 
***
Dr. Cameron: His right testicle is almost twice as big as his left. 
Dr. House: Cool! 
***
Henry: I assume you've been in love? 
Dr. House: Is that the one that makes your pants feel funny? 
***
Dr. House: You met me at a strip club. 
Stacy: You were the worst two dollars I ever spent. 
***
Bill: His name's Joey, he's my only brother. 
Dr. House: He's important to you. Got it. No placebos for him, we'll use the real medicine. 
***
Lucille: I'm not pregnant. 
Dr. House: Sorry, you don't get to make that call unless you have a stethoscope. Union rules. 
***
Carmen Electra: Can I put my pants back on? 
Dr. House: I rather you didn't. 
***
Dr. Chase: You're joking. 
Dr. House: Well, hard not to, nothing funnier than cancer. 
***
Dr. Chase: How would you feel if I interfered in your personal life? 
Dr. House: I'd hate it. That's why I cleverly have no personal life 
***
Dr. Wilson: She's hot, so she's a hooker? What kind of pathetic logic is that? 
Dr. House: The envious, jealous, I never got any in high school kind of logic, hello! 
***
Dr. Cameron: Men should grow up. 
Dr. House: Yeah, and dogs should stop licking their workplace-acceptable euphemism for testicles. It's not going to happen. 
***
Dr. Cuddy: You don't prescribe medicine based on guesses. At least we don't since Tuskeegee and Mengele. 
Dr. House: You're comparing me to a Nazi? [admiringly] Nice 
***
Dr Cuddy: Oh, and I looked up that philosopher, and it turns out that if you try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need. 
***
Dr. House: Patients always want proof. We're not making cars here, we don't give guarantees. 
***
Is your yelling designed to scare me because I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be scared of. More yelling? That's not scary. That you're gonna hurt me? That's scary, but I'm pretty sure I can out run you. 
***
When I hired you, I knew you were insane. I will continue to try and stop you from doing insane things, but once they're done, trying to convince an insane person not to do insane things is, in itself, insane. So when I hired you, I also set aside fifty thousand a year for legal expenses. So far, you've come in under budget. 
***
House: Right rudder. Bank, bank, bank! 
Cuddy: Good coffee? The rest of this hospital is busting its tail and you're... 
[House's eyes get really wide, and he covers them with his folder] 
Cuddy: What are you doing? 
House: Trying to think of anything except the produce department at Whole Foods. 
[Wilson smirks] 
Cuddy: I am working. It got hot. Stop acting like a 13-year-old! 
House: Sorry. You just don't normally see breasts like that on Deans of Medicine. 
[Wilson tries to look anywhere except at Cuddy's chest] 
Cuddy: Women can't be heads of hospitals? Or just ugly ones? 
House: No, they can be babes. It's just you don't normally get to see their fun bags. 
***
Cuddy: ...working with people actually makes you a better doctor. 
House: When did I sign up for that course? 
Cuddy: When did I give you the impression that I care? 
House: Working in this clinic obviously instills a deep sense of compassion. (He threatens her) I've got your home number, right? In case anything comes up at 3 o'clock in the morning. 
Cuddy: It's not going to work. You know why? Because this is fun. You think of something to make me miserable, I think of something to make you miserable: it's a game! And I'm going to win, because I've got a head start. You are already miserable. 
***
House: See, this is why I don't waste money on shrinks, cause you give me all these really great insights for free. 
Cuddy: Shrink. If you would consider going to a shrink, I would pay for it myself. The hospital would hold a bake sale, for God's sake. 
***
House: (complaining about having to teach a course) Why is it always me? 
Cuddy: Because the world hates you. Or because it's a class on diagnostics. Pick whatever reason feeds your narcissism better. 
***
We're going to a gallery; we're not getting married. 
***
House, I'm not in heat. 
***
Then move on to your secret, secret, secret stash 
***
Cuddy: Where did you come from? 
House: Apes, if you believe the Democrats. 
***
I teach you to lie, cheat, and steal, and as soon as my back's turned you wait in line? 
***
Like I always say, there's no I in team. There's a me though, if you jumble it up. 
***
So what's your plan? You take the big dark one, I'll take the little girl, and the Aussie will run like a scared wombat if things get tough. 
***
[Houses' patient has just collapsed] This is exactly why I created nurses. Clean up on aisle three! 
***
It's a basic truth of the human condition that everybody lies. The only variable is about what. 
***
You talk to God, you're religious; God talks to you, you're psychotic. 
***
Treating illness is why we became doctors. Treating patients is actually what makes most doctors miserable. 
***
Truth begins in lies 
***
Humanity is overrated 
***
Reality is almost always wrong 
***
It's one of the great tragedies of life — something always changes. 
***
I was never that great at math, but next to nothing is higher than nothing, right? 
***
There is not a thin line between love and hate. There is - in fact - a Great Wall of China with armed sentries posted every 20 feet between love and hate. 
***
(to Foreman) So your solution is to give me drugs?
