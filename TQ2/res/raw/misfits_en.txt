Nathan: Yeah, Okay. Let’s rob a bank.
Shaun: What’s that?
Simon: Nothing.
Shaun: Well that’s funny, isn’t it? Cause to me, it sounded like you’re planning on robbing a bank.
Nathan: No, no, no. I said, uh… “Let’s have a big wank.” Communal masturbation. The ol’ circle jerk.
***
Nathan: We’re a bunch of young offenders and not one of us knows how to steal a car? This is pathetic!
***
Simon: What’s he doing?
Curtis: He’s trying to smash the bottle with his mind. I think he’s going to shit himself.
***
Nathan: Hey hey, who am I? One luhhhhhhh ohhh yeaaaaaahhhh huh huuuuuhhhhh ahhhhhhh… Come on! Okay, alright, alright. I’ll give you a clue. I’m an annoying cunt.
Alisha: Yeah, we know that.
***
Ben: If you’ve got any questions, just ask
Nathan: If a bear and a shark had a fight, who would win?
***
Nathan: Can you get me a gun?
Kelly: I ain’t getting you a gun.
Nathan: Come on! You know someone, right? Just a little one, nothing too leery.
Kelly: There’s no way I’m getting a dickhead like you a gun.
Simon: You can get a gun off the internet.
***
Ruth: So what did you do?
Nathan: I sexually assaulted a 90 year old woman.
Ruth: That’s funny.
Nathan: She didn’t seem to think so at the time. God rest her soul.
***
Simon: Maybe he’s a werewolf.
Nathan: Twat!
Simon: That’s what happens in films. You turn into a werewolf, you kill someone, and you wake up somewhere naked… Like a zoo…
***
Nathan: You’re just as screwed as the rest of us! You’re black and famous! You’re probably more screwed!
***
Nathan: We put them in those wheelchairs, we wheel them up there, and if anyone sees us, we’re just a bunch of young offenders takin’ a couple of specials for a walk in the sunshine!
***
Nathan smashes Proation workers car's front window with a brick.
Probation worker: What the hell are you doing?!?
Nathan: It's, just....Pure mindless vandalism!
Probation worker: What is the matter with you?!?! Are you mentally defictant?!?!
Nathan: If i was mentally defictant, i would have missed. Check that out * POints to car* Bullseye.
***
Nathan: Didn't you say you wanted to piss on her tits?!? 
Simeon: That's the sort of thing you keep between you and your internet service provider!
***
Rudy: What are you doing?
Kelly: Design a new propulsion system.
Rudy: Why?
Kelly: Because I'm a fucking rocket scientist!
***
Kelly: It's not Jesus, it's some dickhead with a few superpowers.
***
Alisha: Where are you going?
Simon: I'm going to kill Jesus.
Alisha: I'm coming with you.
***
Nathan: Why is a gorilla wearing a gorilla costume?
***
Nathan: It's much easier to humiliate, degrade and just generally shit all over someone than it is to admit that you love them!
***
Nathan: I'm no good at this serious girl stuff, feelings and shit. I fancy you!
Kelly: Fanks
***
Nathan: Yeah so my mum opens the door and she's like 'Ahhhhh' & I'm like 'I'm Immortal!' & then fanted, face plants on the radiator. There's blood and teeth everywhere.
Kelly: Is she alright?
Nathan: Yeah, she's fine. Apart from the whole... face.
***
Alisha: Er, if I was gonna suck someones cock, trust me, it wouldn't be his.
***
Nathan: Can we please stop killing our probation workers?
***
Simon: You expect me to tell you anything after how you've treated me? After all the names you've called me?
Nathan: What names?
Simon: Weird kid. Panty sniffer. Virgin. Freak. Twat. Pervert. Paedophile... Melon fucker! I just want to be your friend.
Nathan: Sure, man.
***
Curtis: [Nathan wakes up out of the coffin] What the fuck?
Nathan: You should see the looks on your faces. Classic! Hey guess what? I'm immortal! Can you believe this shit? I've told you I had a power. Oh, looks like they saved the best for last, huh? Immortality... that's off the A-list.
***
Nathan: [Discussing a plan for dealing with the Virtue group] Come on, Barry, you're good at this stuff. Think of something.
Simon: Who's Barry?
Nathan: You are.
Kelly: His name is Simon.
Nathan: Is it? I thought it was Barry.
***
Nathan: When did you get balls?
Simon: I've always had balls, you've just never seen them.
Nathan: That's the gayest thing I've ever heard.
***
Curtis: Go on then. Turn invisible.
Simon: I can't do it when everyone's watching me.
Nathan: So I guess it's like pissing at a urinal if you've got a tiny cock
***
Nathan: It's not like this situation is backed up by a wank-load of logic.
***
Curtis: My mum told me to stay away from girls like you.
Alisha Bailey: Your mum has never met a girl like me.
***
Nathan: He's not a werewolf, OK. This guy is such a pussy, he needs my mum to open jars for him. If he was a werewolf he'd be able to open a jar of peanut butter for himself.
***
Nathan: What about you, weird kid? Don't take this the wrong way or anything, but you look like a panty sniffer.
Simon: I'm not a panty sniffer. I'm not a pervert. I tried to burn someone's house down.
***
Kelly: What if there's loads of people like us all over town?
Nathan: No, that kind of thing only happens in America. This will fade away. I'm telling you, by this time next week, it'll be back to the same old boring shit.
***
Nathan: I mean, I was there, right? I should have one of these bullshit powers.
Kelly: You can have mine. Wanna hear what people are thinking about you?
Nathan: Not so much, no. I want something good, you know, something from the A-list.
***
Simon: What if we are meant to be, like, superheroes?
Nathan: You lot, superheroes? No offence, but in what kind of fucked-up world would that be allowed to happen?
***
Tony: There are people out there who think you're scum. You have an opportunity to show them they're wrong.
Nathan: Yeah, but what if they're right? No offense, but I'm thinking some people are just born criminals.
Gary: Are you looking to get stabbed?
Nathan: You see my point there?
***
Nathan: I'm no doctor, but you see the way the side of his head's all caved in like that...?
***
Nathan: [Looking at Kelly] I'm guessing shoplifting...?
***
Kelly: What did you do?
Nathan Young: Me? I was done for eating some pick n' mix.
***
Tony: [after the lightning strikes a car] That's my car!
Nathan Young: Classic!
***
Kelly: [in thick East Midlands accent] Ehm, wot makes ya thin' that yer better than ozz?
Nathan: What is *that* accent?
Curtis: Is that for real?
Kelly: Wot, you tryin' to say soomfin 'ou' it, then, yah?
Nathan Young: It's a - are you - that's just a noise! Are we supposed to be able to understand her?
***
Kelly: You know after the storm, did any of you lot feel like dead weird?
Nathan Young: Yeah. I had a strange tingling sensation in my anus.
***
Simon: Maybe we're meant to be like superheroes.
Nathan: You lot? Superheroes? No offense but in what sort of fucked up world would that be allowed to happen.
***
Nathan: I'm pretty sure this breeches the terms of my ASBO (anti-social behaviour order).
***
Nathan Young: Probably best to keep that kinda thing between you and your internet service provider.
