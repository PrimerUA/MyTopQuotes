Eric: I KNOW I'm a vampire, Snookie.
Sookie: It's SOOKIE!***
Pam: Did I miss something? Are we girls now? Did we join a book club and read some queer chick lit memoirs and are bound together by estrogen or sisterhood some other feminist drivel?***
Sookie: You killed my fairy godmother.
Eric: Sorry.***
Sookie: What do you want from me?
Eric: Everything.***
Nan [to Bill]: You've got Queen on you.***
Jessica: I can eat who I want.***
Pam: Technology takes all the fun out of being a vampire.***
Terry: When I was a kid, I used to put a squirrel head on a lizard body and invent animals.***
Eric: Who would you refer to trust? A politician or a vampire?***
Eric [upon seeing Sookie naked]: Such a strange sensation when the reality matches what you've pictured in your mind so precisely.***
Lafayette: We'll stay for five minutes. 10 if they got dranks.***
Sookie: I have a fairy godmother? Okay, if your job is to look after me, can I just say you suck.***
Sookie: Wait a minute. I thought you're supposed to be invisible in the mirror.
Bill: We started many of the mysteries about ourselves centuries ago.
Sookie: What about holy water?
Bill: It's just water.
Sookie: Crucifixes?
Bill: Geometry.
Sookie: Garlic?
Bill: It's irritating. That's pretty much it.***
Sam: Sookie, you have no future with a vampire!
Sookie: They don't die. I've got nothing but a future with one.***
Jason: Look, Gran, I am the man in this family.
Gran: You are a man in this family, but I am the oldest person here and this is my house. You better respect me boy.
Bill: Actually, I'm the oldest person here.***
Bill: Can I ask you a personal question?
Sookie: Bill, you were just licking blood outta my head. I don't think it gets much more personal than that.***
Lafayette: All right, all right. I is on my way. But you might got ta find your own ride home. Just in case I get lucky.
Tara: Whatchu mean if you get lucky? Your standards are so low you always get lucky.***
Sookie: What I am is telepathic. I can hear people's thoughts.
Bill: Even mine?
Sookie: No. That's why I like you so much. I can't hear you at all. You have no idea how peaceful it is, after a lifetime of... blah, blah, blah...***
Tara [about Maryann]: So, collecting stray black people. That some kind of hobby of hers?
Eggs: She's right about you. You are funny.
Tara: Oh, yeah? What else she tell you about me?
Eggs: She said you crashed your car with a gallon of whiskey in your lap.
Tara: It was vodka. Really cheap vodka.***
Orry Dawson: Officially the church can not condone what you did. You took the lives of four women. Women who had tainted themselves and their race. But still human women... But we do recognize that your methods may have been flawed, your intentions were pure.
Jason: I have no idea what you're talking about.
Orry Dawson: That's smart. Don't admit to anything.***
Bill: She won't listen to me. It will take more time than I have to teach her obedience.
Jessica: I don't obey anybody, those days are over!
Eric: Can't handle one little girl, Bill? New ones can be like this. Man up my friend, she is not even one night old.***
Sam: [to Arlene, about her party] What do you want it took look like?
Terry: A débutante ball.
Arlene: Hug your neck! You know exactly what I'm talkin' about.
Sam : How did you know what she wanted?
Terry: My cousin Portia was a deb, from Shreveport when she turned 18. Every Bellefleur woman has been doin' it since they started to have 'em before the Revolutionary war.
Sam: Must be nice to come from such an old family.
Terry: All families are old, Sam. Some just keep better records.***
Pam [handing Sookie a leather outfit]: Put these on.
Sookie: Oh, thank you. But I'm fine really. I'm just gonna dry out my hair and be on my way.
Pam: You're not going anywhere. Eric and your boyfriend aren't nearly done talking just yet.
Sookie: Is... Bill is some kind of trouble?
Pam: That's for the boys to figure out. Right now what you need to do is change out of your clothes... there's vampire in your cleavage.***
Sookie: I've been admiring your necklace all day.
Amy: Oh, thanks. It's a lariat. I made it.
Sookie: You make jewelry?
Amy: Easy way to earn extra money. I can make you one if you want.
Sookie: Thanks, but I don't think my boyfriend much likes silver.***
Amy [entring Merlotte's]: Intense! All these animals on the wall, it's like a natural history museum.
Jason: Hah! I never noticed them.
Amy: How could you not? Everyone of these animals lived a life full of experiences that we can't even imagine!
Jason: Does that weird you out? We could always go someplace else!
Amy: No, no. Everyone has to eat, right? We are all links on the universal food chain. See, squirrel eats nuts, snake eat the squirrel, gator eat the snake... and we can eat pretty much everything we want. It's the circle of life.
Jason: Jesus Christ! I wanna lick your mind!
Amy: Let's have lunch first.***
Bill: What do you want?
Malcolm: You never called me back. Now if I remember what feelings were, mine might be hurt***
Sookie: Wow. I feel a little weak.
Bill: Of course you do. I fed on your blood. You should take some vitamin B-12 to replenish.
Sookie: Will I need to do that everyday?
Bill: If you don't mind, yes. And no garlic.***
Jason: I love the smell of nail polish in the morning***
Sheriff Bud Dearborne: Come by the station in the morning and I'll give you your badge back.
Andy Bellefleur: Really? I won't let you down Bud. And I am never touching another drink again.
Sheriff Bud Dearborne: This town's a hell of a mess and I'm man enough to know I can't shoulder it myself.... You might have your faults Andy but at least you got pants on.***
Jason: It's like if a tree falls in the woods it's still a tree, ain't it?***
Sophie-Anne: Surely you know that everything that exists imagined itself into existence***
Sophie-Anne: Maenads are sad, silly things... relics who believe in the God who comes.
Bill: Does he ever come?
Sophie-Anne: Of course not. Gods only exist in humans' minds, like money or morality.***
Lettie Mae: If only Miss Jeanette was still alive.
Lafayette [about Tara]: She don't need no backwards witch. She needs Thorazine and padded cell.***
Lafayette [after reciting a prayer]: Jesus and I agreed to see other people, but that don't mean we still don't talk time to time.***
Bill: Tara, you are safe here. You have to do exactly as I say.
Tara: I am not your f**king slave girl.
Lafayette: If there ever there was a time to listen to a white man, Tara, this is it.***
Sookie: Jason, this would be one of those times to use your head.
Jason: Oh, I am. This here is the war I've been training for.***
Lorena [to Sookie]: Did you know your boyfriend hit me over the head with a 52 inch plasma television earlier tonight? Everyone says they're so thin and light, but let me tell you, when wielded properly, they're quite a weapon.***
Jason [about Steve]: That sonuvabitch. It's like he sucked out my brain and planted all his own babies there.***
Sookie: He's your maker isn't he?
Eric: Don't use words you don't understand.
Sookie: You have a lot of love for him.
Eric: Don't use words I don't understand.***
Steve: I will not negotiate with sub humans. Kill me. Do it. Jesus will protect me.
Godric: I am actually older than your Jesus. I wish I could have known him but I missed it.***
Hoyt: I ain't never done it... with a girl I mean.
Jessica: What have you done it with?
Hoyt: Just myself.
Jessica: Oh ,so you're a virgin? Oh well, big whoop. So what?***
Eric: Tell me, what is that you find so fulfilling about human companionship?
Isabella: They feel much more strongly than we do. Everything is urgent, exciting. Maybe because their lives are so temporary.
Eric: Yes, they certainly don't keep well. Do you have the prospect of him growing old, sickly, crippled somewhat repulsive?
Isbaella: No, I find it curious, like a science project.***
Sarah [about Steve]: He's not the man I thought he was. You're not being trained to defend us. He wants to use you to start a war. He's vicious and he's cruel, and he uses the C word. And he lies to me, Jason. Our marriage has always been a partnership, and now he's shutting me out***
Jessica: I'm so happy I could cry, but I won't cause it's gross when I do.***
Tara: Want me to take a look [at the water heater] and you can hold the line?
Eggs: See that was some spiteful s**t you just said there. I got this.
I'm the man of the house. No offense, Carl..
Carl: None taken***
Eric: The vampires here, they're like cowboys. If they don't get Godric back they'll want justice. They'll start attacking people.
Bill: Open aggression against humans? That's insane.
Eric: Well, it's Texas.***
Hoyt: You should try the chicken fried steak. It's like a chicken and a steak got together and made a baby. A delicious, crispy baby.***
Jessica: This is so embarrassing. I'd die if i wasn't already dead.***
Eric: You surprise me. That's rare in a breather.
Sookie: You disgust me.
Eric: Perhaps I'll grow on you.
Sookie: I'd prefer cancer.***
Bill: She has no humanity, she's in the grips of overwhelming transformations, there will be times when she cannot control even a single impulse...and believe me she HAS many.
Sookie: ...How is that any different from being a teenage girl.***
Lafayette: Make me a vampire.
Eric: I beg your pardon?
Lafayette: You can put me to work in the bar...I'm a good dancer you've seen it on my site. (Eric walks around to him) Shit, I'd get up there and I'd move Earth and Heaven go-go style.
Eric: You are aware there's a gaping hole in your leg? You're damaged goods.
Lafayette: Not if you turn me. I'd be good as ever. Look I...I'm already a person of poor moral character. So, I hit the ground running and I damn near glamour people already. Gimme what ya'll got...not only will I be a bad-ass vampire, but I'd be your bad-ass vampire.***
Bill: Your bedtime will be 4 a.m., not a minute later... We also recycle in this house.
