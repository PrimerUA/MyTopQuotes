Bernadette: - I love that man.
Raj: - Me too.
***
Sheldon: - Would you like some aloe vera? You just got burned.
***
Sheldon: - I'll do it provided I can perform the service in Klingon.
Bernadette: - No.
Sheldon: - What do you see in her? 
***
Amy: Oh my gosh. I can't believe my maid of honor dress will be on Google Earth!
***
Sheldon: - Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.
***
Sheldon: - Soft Kitty, Warm Kitty, Little Ball of Fur! Happy Kitty, Sleepy Kitty, Pur, Pur, Pur!
***
Sheldon: - 'He drank from Leonard`s glass' - the words they will be carving into my tombstone.
***
Sheldon: - I'm not insane, my mother had me tested! 
***
Leonard: -What were you doing at Penny's?
Sheldon: - Well, we had dinner, played some games, and then I spent the night. Oh, and you'll be happy to know that I now have a much better understanding of 'friends with benefits.
***
Leonard:-  I know what your doing.
Sheldon: - You do?
Leonard: - You're using chocolate as a positive reinforcement for what you consider is a correct behavior!
Sheldon: - Very good! Chocolate? 
***
Penny: - So, what do you guys do for fun around here?
Sheldon: - Well, today we tried masturbating for money. 
***
Sheldon: - A neutron walks into a bar and asks how much for a drink. The bartender replies for you, no charge.
***
Sheldon: - I'm sorry, coffee's out of the question. When I moved to California I promised my mother that I wouldn't start doing drugs.
***
Leonard:- For God's sake, Sheldon, do I have to hold up a sarcasm sign every time I open my mouth?  
Sheldon (intrigued): - You have a sarcasm sign?
***
Sheldon: - At my age do you know how I'm statistically most likely to die?
Leonard: - At the hands of your room mate?
Sheldon: - An accident.
Leonard: - That's how I'm going to make it look.
***
Sheldon: - Penny. 
Penny: - Yeah.
Sheldon: - Thanks for letting me stay here.
Penny: - Oh, you're welcome sweetie.
Sheldon: - Okay, I'm sleepy now get out.
***
Leonard: - Have you considered telling her how you feel? 
Sheldon: - Leonard, I'm a physicist, not a hippie.
***
Sheldon: - Checkmate.
Leonard: - Oh, again?
Sheldon: - Obviously, you're not suited for three dimensional chess. Perhaps three dimensional Candy Land would be more your speed. 
Leonard: - Just reset the board!
Sheldon: - It must be humbling to suck on so many levels.
***
Sheldon: - You can try, but you'll never catch me. Bazinga!
***
Sheldon: -  A little misunderstanding? Galileo and the Pope had a little misunderstanding...
***
Sheldon: - This is the temperature you agreed to in the roommate agreement. 
Leonard: - Aw, screw the roommate agreement!
Sheldon: - No, you don't screw the roommate agreement. The roommate agreement screws you.
***
Howard: - Hope you don't mind, I told my girlfriend, Bernadette, she can join us for dinner.
Leonard: - Sure, the more the merrier.
Sheldon: - Wait, no. That's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there was 2000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating? No, we'd be suffocating.
***
Wolowitz: - But you love that spot.
Sheldon: -No, I love my mother, my feelings for my spot are much greater.
***
Sheldon: - All I need is a healthy ovum and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy!
***
Sheldon: - For the record, I do have genitals. They're functional and aesthetically pleasing.
***
Sheldon:-  I am the ball, my thoughts are its thoughts, its holes are my holes.
***
Leonard: - Sheldon, you can't train my girlfriend like a lab rat!
Sheldon: - Actually, it turns out I can.
***
Leonard: - Relax, it's just a dirty sock.
Sheldon: - How on earth can you say dirty sock and relax in the same sentence?
***
Sheldon: - She calls me moon-pie because I'm nummy-nummy and she could eat me up!
***
Leonard: - I'm just saying, you catch more flies with honey then with vinegar. 
Sheldon: - You catch even more with manure, what's your point? 
***
Sheldon: - If you don't mind, I'd like to stop listening to you and start talking.
***
Sheldon: - No mother, I could not feel your church group praying for my safety. The fact that I am home safe does not prove it worked, that logic is post hoc ergo propter hoc. No, I'm not sassing you in Eskimo talk.
***
Sheldon: - Biologically speaking, Howard is perfectly justified in seeking out the optimum mate for the propagation of his genetic line.
Wolowitz: - Thank you, Sheldon.
Sheldon: - And whether that propigation is in the interest of humanity is, of course, an entirely different question.
***
Leonard: - Come on, Sheldon. It will be fun.
Sheldon: -That's what you said about the Green Lantern movie. You were 114 minutes of wrong.
***
Leonard: - What are you doing?
Amy: - We're playing doctor. Star Trek style.
Sheldon: - I'm in hell, Leonard. Don't stop.
***
Sheldon: - Can I ask you a question about women?
Leonard: - I got you that book last year, wasn't everything in there?
***
Leonard: - You are not Isaac Newton. 
Sheldon: - No, no, that’s true. Gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple.
***
Sheldon: -(To Priya) You may have gone to Cambridge but I'm an honorary graduate of Starfleet Academy.
***
Sheldon: - Penny, while I subscribe to the Many Worlds theory which posits the existence of an infinite number of Sheldons in an infinite number of universes, I assure you that in none of them am I dancing.
***
Sheldon: - She's 93. She won't be disappointed for very long.
***
Sheldon: - Well, well, well, if it isn't Wil Wheaton. The Green Goblin to my Spider-Man, the Pope Paul V to my Galileo, the Internet Explorer to my Firefox!
***
Sheldon: - What type of Computer do you have? And please don't say a white one.
***
Sheldon: - There there, everything is going to be fine... Sheldon's here!
***
Sheldon: - Come back here, you stupid bird, so I can love you.
***
Sheldon: - Leonard, when that woman moved in three years ago I told you not to talk to her, and now look. We're going to be late for the movies.
***
Howard: - Tell her I'm really sorry. And if she doesn't want to marry me, I get it. But what I really want her to know is the guy that she is really disgusted by is the guy that I'm disgusted by, too. But, that guy doesn't exist anymore; he's gone. And the reason is because of her. So, if this relationship is over, let her know that she made me a better man, and tell her thank you.
Penny: - Oh my god, Howard! That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. And it came out of you.
***
Bernadette: - You lied to me. You said you told me about all the girls you've been with, but you never mentioned your cousin, the prostitute or Raj!
***
Penny: - No big deal. Not knowing is part of the fun!
Sheldon: - (Imitating Penny) 'Not knowing is part of the fun.' Was that the motto of your community college?
***
Raj: - (Talking to the snake) Let's go to the biology lab and find you some nice yummy mice. *Raj leaves the room*
Sheldon: - I tried to scare an Indian with a snake. Come on, Cooper. You're better than this.
***
Sheldon: - My new computer came with Windows 7. Windows 7 is much more user-friendly than Windows Vista......I don't like that.
***
Sheldon: - I must say, Amy, pretending to have intercourse with you has given me a great deal of satisfaction.
***
Sheldon: - Eat this slice of cheese without farting and you can sleep with my sister.
***
Sheldon: - Pee for Houston, pee for Austin.
Pee for the state my heart got lost in.
And shake twice for Texas.
***
Sheldon: - I'm trying to raise the temperature in here before my nipples tear through my shirt.
***
Sheldon: - Wine and a girl in the dark ... he's going to be bored out of his mind.
***
Sheldon: - Hello, I know you're out there. I can hear you metabolizing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide.
***
Sheldon: -When you understand the laws of physics, Penny, anything is possible. And may I add, Mwah, ha, ha.
***
Sheldon: - It's not cartoons, it's anime!
***
Sheldon: - Oh, Penny! Penny!
Penny: - What's up?
Sheldon: - Nothing. I just wanted to make Raj stop talking.
***
Penny: - Sheldon have you changed your wireless password again?
Sheldon: - Yes, it's Penny get your own WiFi; no spaces.
***
Sheldon: - Question: Where are my Pants?
***
Sheldon: - Sorry, I'm late!
Leonard: - What happened?
Sheldon: - Nothing! I just didn't wanna come.
***
Sheldon: -Hulk sad!
***
Sheldon: - Good night. And if there's an apocalypse, good luck.
***
Sheldon: - Good grief. It's like talking to a dolphin.
***
Sheldon: - What an elf I would've made.
***
Sheldon:-  I gaggled with tequila. I may have swallowed a tiny bit.
Leonard: - You all right?
Sheldon: - Fine, thank you for asking. I love you so much!
***
Sheldon: - Geology isn't a real science!
***
Amy: - I was proposing massaging your muscles with your own hands.
Sheldon: - Still sounds like a lot of unnecessary touching.
***
Sheldon: - I'm clearly too evolved for driving.
***
Sheldon: - There's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.
***
Sheldon: - What I am doing here is trying to determine when I am going to die.
Leonard: - A lot of people are working on that research.
***
Raj: - You want me to work with you?
Sheldon: - For me!
***
Sheldon: - *Sees Leonard & Penny kissing* Oh, frickity frack! Not this again!
***
Sheldon: - I was expecting applause but I suppose stunned silence is equally appropriate.
***
Penny: - (Upset, about Kurt) 4 years, I lived with him. 4 years, that's like as long as high school.
Sheldon: - It took you 4 years to get through high school?
***
Leonard: -Hope, you're hungry!
Sheldon: - Interesting, a friendly sentiment in this country - a cruel taunt in the Sudan...
***
Sheldon: - I understand why you're upset. You're afraid that costume makes you look fat.
***
Sheldon: - I never joke about safety.
***
Sheldon: - Captain hook's hand was eaten by a crocodile not an alligator. If you're going to insult me at least get your facts straight.
***
Sheldon: - You keep in mind that my sharply-worded comments on Yelp.com recently took down a muffin store.
***
Sheldon: - Leonard, be serious. We're playing a game here.
***
Sheldon: - (Going apologize to Penny) I have a masters and two PhDs. I should not have to do this.
***
Sheldon: - Level 3 and she think she's rich. What a noob!
***
Sheldon: - Oh gooody, we're getting a cat.
***
Sheldon: - That seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse. Don't you have access to women who will do it for money?
***
Sheldon: - 1234 is not a secure password.
***
Sheldon: - Bring out the Red Bull, it’s time to rock Mario old school!
***
Sheldon: - To amend the words of Toy Story, you have not got a friend in me.
***
Sheldon: - I have a Masters degree and two Doctorates. The things I *should* know, I do know
***
Sheldon: - Do you even think about other people, Leonard?
***
