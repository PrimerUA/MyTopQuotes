Vanozza (to Cesare): - We're dancing on your brother's grave.
***
Vanozza: - So Cesare, what exactly are you celebrating? Your sisters betrothal, or the death of your brother?
***
Cesare: - This is not God's doing, father.
Pope: - Everything is God's doing!
***
Pope: - And you, he was your brother. You show no tears? Are you stone?
***
Lucrezia: - I have wished him dead a thousand times.
***
Lucrezia: - You asked who would do such a thing. The answer is many people, father.
***
Lucrezia: - Yes, I will marry him. He has all the sweetness of an apple on a tree.
***
Micheletto: - I stand in awe, your eminence.
Cesare: - You killed your father.
Micheletto: - Still, I stand in awe.
***
Vanozza: - What happened to you Juan? You were such a lovely child.
***
Micheletto: - This dog will come back and bite.
***
Hernando: - God gives you riches, and you kill for more.
***
Juan: - If you don't have the stomach for this spectacle, you'll find that Spain lies that way.
***
Rodrigo: - What is this called?
Juan: Smoking!
***
Rodrigo: - Save your thoughts. Say nothing.
Cesare: - I haven't uttered a word.
Rodrigo: - No, but we can hear you thinking.
***
Della Rovere: - I was poisoned with cantarella, and I am now the stronger for it.
***
Rodrigo: - Was it a sign from God, Cardinal?
Cardinal Sforza: - No your holiness. It was a bolt of lightning.
***
Kid: - I would gladly die to rid the world of the Borgia Pope.
***
Rodrigo: - Know your enemy, Cardinal. Know him better than your friend.
***
Cesare: - I can't imagine you being born, Micheletto...or dying for that matter.
