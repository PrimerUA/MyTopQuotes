Sura: The council has decided? 
Spartacus: We go to war. 
Sura: I've asked the gods to bless your sword. 
Spartacus: Once the Geti are wiped from our lands there will be no reason to ever pick it up again. 
Sura: What would my husband do without it in his hands? 
Spartacus: Grow crops, raise goats, make children. 
Sura: You would fight no more? 
Spartacus: Forever, to be by your side. 
Sura: How soon do you march? 
Spartacus: At first light. 
Sura: Then come to bed. If one night is all we have left, I should make the most of it. 
***
Spartacus: I woke expecting my wife beside me. 
Sura: She rose early to pray, that her husband would stay with her. 
Spartacus: I thought we were in agreement. Sura: We were. 
Spartacus: Were? Sura: The gods came to me last night, in my sleep. 
Spartacus: What did they show you? 
Sura: My husband on his knees, bowing before a great red serpent, the life draining from his veins. 
Spartacus: What meaning did you take from it? 
Sura: A warning. If you go to war you are destined for great and unfortunate things. 
Spartacus: The Geti worship the mountain wolf, they place no faith in snakes. It was just a dream. 
Sura: And if it isn't? 
Spartacus: I gave my word Sura. Blood and honor, it speaks to the man. Nothing will keep me from returning to your arms. Not the Geti, not the Romans, not the gods themselves. 
Sura: The nights grow so cold. What am I to do without you in our bed?
Spartacus: Lift your dress (She does, he ties a piece of his cloak arond her leg) keep me close to your thighs. The thought will warm us both. 
Sura: Kill them all. 
Spartacus: For you. 
***
Glaber: Align yourself with Rome, pledge your service the auxiliary, and join us in our campaign. 
Spartacus: To what end, to what end?
Glaber: Victory. 
Spartacus: And how is it to be measured? The Geti have raided our villages in the past, raped our women, and killed our children. Each time we have pushed them back, only to see them return. If we are to align with Rome, the purpose must be clear. The Geti dead, all of them. 
Glaber: Dead, all of them. 
***
Albinius: What name does the man carry? 
Glaber: I never cared to ask. 
Batiatus: The way he fights like thelegend of the Thracian king of old, Spartacus he was called. 
***
Batiatus: Why are you here, in this place, under my hospitality? Do you know why? 
Spartacus: Because I trusted in the honor of a Roman. 
Batiatus: You are here because of my grandfather. He built this ludus. He believed that no man was without worth. That even the most vile among us could rise to honor and glory. He instilled these beliefs in my father, who in turn passed them on to me. I am a lanista. Like my forefathers, a trainer of gladiators. I see things in men that they themselves have lost, small spark, an ember, I give it breath, tender, until it ignites in the arena. 
***
Batiatus: Well then, how do you know she still lives? 
Spartacus: How do you know the heart beats beneath your chest? 
Batiatus: Most days I don't. I'm just a simple Roman trying to make his way against the whim of the gods, the politicians, the miscreants. So often you can't tell one from the other, but you. You are the most dangerous of animals, beast born of the heart. 
***
Batiatus: What would you do to hold your wife again, to feel the warmth of her skin, to taste her lips, would you kill? 
Spartacus: Whoever stood between us. 
Batiatus: How many men? A hundred, A thousand? 
Spartacus: I would kill them all. 
Batiatus: Then do it in the arena. Fight for me, and the honor of my forefathers. Prove yourself, climb to the pinnacle, gain your freedom, and that of the woman you've lost. 
Spartacus: I did not lose her. She was taken from me. 
Batiatus: A man must accept his fate, or be destroyed by it. 
Spartacus: Why would I place my fate in the hands of another Roman? 
Batiatus: Because of what they hold. Your wife's? Pass the final test tonight with honor and servitude, call me Dominus, and I will help to reunite you. The choice is yours. 
***
Lucretia: Darling, you must spend coins to receive coins. My husband taught me that. 
Batiatus: A wise man. Lucretia: He has his moments. 
***
Naevia: Wait. 
Crixus: Domina will grow impatient. You know the urgency of her desires. 
Naevia: She did not summon you. 
Crixus: Then why am I here? 
Naevia: The necklace? You purchased it for me? 
Crixus: As I've said. Naevia: Then why does it grace the neck of Domina? [Crixus laughs, incredulous] 
Crixus: The mind of a woman, you deflect a gesture only to question where it lands. Your words were I cannot accept it. 
Naevia: Yes, my words, cut off before completion. 
Crixus: Then complete. 
Naevia: That it is impossible for me to keep it, regardless of desire. There is nothing in my possession that was not given to me by Domina. Are you so thick that this fact was ignored? Did you think she would not notice? 
Crixus: [apologetically] I misunderstood your meaning in returning it. 
Naevia: Of course you misunderstood. You have no mind outside the arena, you think only with your sword and your shield, you stupid lumbering...[she is cut off as Crixus kisses her, but after briefly kissing him back she abruptly ends it] You are a fool... Guard! 
***
Sura: Your wounds... 
Spartacus: I'm allright. 
Sura: You push yourself too far. 
Spartacus: And yet I live. Sura: For how long? 
Spartacus: As long as it takes. 
Sura: Then kill them all. 
***
Spartacus: It will end one day, and we will be reunited. 
***
Spartacus: Glory? 
Crixus: There is no greater thing than standing victorious in the arena. 
Spartacus: Is there no purpose... beyond the blood? No dream beyond the cheering crowd? Is there nothing else you fight for? 
***
Theokoles: Capua, shall I begin! 
***
Batiatus: My word is kept, they're reunited. 
***
Spartacus: What else did the Gods tell you about my future? 
Sura: That you will never love another woman. 
***
Crixus: You strike a solid blow, against an ill-trained fool who taints the name of Gaul. 
Spartacus: He may a fool. But he is one who is fit to train. Again! 
Crixus: You doubt that I am fully healed? Because I will show you otherwise! 
***
Spartacus: You over-reach, and here is the result. 
Crixus: Do not address me as you would a recruit. Spartacus: Then do not act like one. 
Crixus: Words of import, from the mighty Spartacus. Bringer of rain, slayer of Theokoles. As if you stood against him on your own! Without my aid, you would have nothing. Not even your miserable life. 
Spartacus: True. Yet here I stand, and there you sit. 
Crixus: You know shit, about being a champion. Of being a true brother. You're only playing at your own part. And one day the game will end. Spartacus: Death comes to us all. Press me again, and you shall find yours. 
***
Spartacus: You would kill a fellow Gaul, to save a man you hate? 
Crixus: I did not save Spartacus. I saved a brother, who shares the mark. You have earned a glorious death, and shall die at the hands of a gladiator. 
***
Lucretia: (to Mira) And I expect his cock in you, or you will find a sword in its place. "Spartacus": you should know never to awake a gladiator 
***
Varro: Aurelia tells me Sicilia is a island blessed by the Gods. You must visit us there when you gain freedom. 
Spartacus: I no longer concern myself with thoughts beyond these walls. 
Crixus: And nor should you. A true champion dreams only of the arena. 
Spartacus: And what does one dream of when he's no longer a champion? Crixus: Regaining the title from the thief who stole it from me. 
***
Spartacus: It is a distance to travel- from a woman's mouth to the man's ears. 
***
Illythia: The choices you make tonight will ripple through time, altering fates and destinies. 
***
Varro: There is no choice. 
Spartacus: There is always a choice. 
***
Sura: Why did you kill him? 
Spartacus: I had no choice, a man must accept his fate. 
Sura: Or be destroyed by it. 
***
[Crowd boos at the sight of Crixus] Crixus: They have forgotten the honor I have brought them. 
Doctore: Then it is time that you reminded them who their true champion is. 
***
Ashur: Crixus! A parting gift. 
Crixus: What is this shit? 
***
Crixus: Dominus finally decides to remove you from the company of men. 
Ashur: Far removed. I've been given favored quarters within the villa, to serve as our master's right hand. Crixus: The one he wipes his ass with. 
***
Batiatus: That shit fuck! Beckons me to the city only to spurn me like a thin wasted? whore. Once again the gods spread the cheeks and ram cock in fucking ass! 
***
Crixus: I have destroyed us. 
***
Spartacus: You move well. As if lash had never struck. 
Crixus: Pain is erased when inflicted upon others. Spartacus: I would have you at your best when we face each other. 
Crixus: Is that all you'd have for me. Rhaskos speaks of your desires. What fever grips brain, that Spartacus would think me to band with him. To risk the lives of my men, my life. 
Spartacus: Is there one, without the woman you love within it? 
Crixus: I've never had a stronger reason to live. 
Spartacus: I know your heart Crixus. I felt the beating of it within my chest once. 
Crixus: Then you know I'll fucking survive, and see Naevia returned to me. 
Spartacus: As my wife was returned. Batiatus ordered her death. 
Crixus: How did you come upon this? 
Spartacus: The tongue of his man Aulus before silencing it forever. I will see the house of Batiatus fall, and with it the villain's blood upon the earth. 
Crixus: As would I in your position, but I am far removed. My escape would not aid Naevia. How would I purchase her freedom? Or even find her while being hunted like a dog by the Romans. 
Spartacus: Join me, and we will find her together. 
Crixus: You know that in another life, you and I may have been as brothers. But not in this one. I must win my freedom in the arena. 
Spartacus: Then we stand in the way of each other's cause. 
Crixus: And both are just, but if I fall I'd have you swear to find Naevia, see her freed. 
Spartacus: And I would have word that if you are victorious, one day you will have Batiatus' life (the two shake hands, sealing the arrangement). Tomorrow then, one of us dies. 
Crixus: I fear it was always fated so. 
***
Spartacus: I have done this thing because it is just. Blood demands blood. We have lived and lost at the whims of our masters for too long. I would not have it so. I would not see the passing of a brother, for the purpose of sport. I would not see another heart ripped from a chest, or breath forfeit for no cause. I know not all of you wish this, yet it is done. It is done. Your lives are your own. Forge your own path, or join with us, and together we shall see Rome tremble. 
***
Batiatus: You were nothing before me. I gave you everything. I gave you the means to accept your fate. Spartacus: Now you are destroyed by it. [Spartacus kills Batiatus] 
***
Spartacus: What would you do, to hold your wife again? To feel the warmth of her skin, the taste of her lips? How many men would you kill? A hundred? A thousand? There stands but one between you and her.
***
Naevia: Honour and glory. That's all you care about, isn't it?
Crixus: Not all.
Naevia: Still the fool.
Crixus: Still.
***
Spartacus: I believe in opportunity. And the power of reason to seize upon it.
***
Batiatus: [after a new recruit is quickly killed in a test] Not every venture ends in climax. 
Lucretia: A fact known well to many women.
***
Spartacus: That is not what she called me. That is not my name.
***
Doctore: The fear in your eyes betray the lie on your tongue.
***
Naevia : To have you, but not have you. It is a wound beyond healing.
***
The ego bruises deeper than the flesh.
***
Spartacus: It is a distance to travel...
from a woman's mouth to a man's ears.
***
Freedom is not a stick of wood to be presented as a bone to obedient dog. It is a thing all men deserve.
***
