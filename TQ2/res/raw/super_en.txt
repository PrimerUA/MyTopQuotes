[Dean falls on top of Sam as they sneak through a half open window] 
Dean Winchester: Oh, sorry! 
Sam Winchester: OK, be quiet. 
Dean Winchester: Me be quiet? You be quiet! 
***
Dean Winchester: I hope your apple pie is freakin' worth it! 
***
Dean Winchester: Ugh, the thought of him driving my car. 
Sam Winchester: Oh, come on. 
Dean Winchester: It's killing me! 
Sam Winchester: Let it go. 
***
Sam Winchester: Dean, there's ten times as much lore about angels as there is about anything else we've ever hunted. 
Dean Winchester: You know what, there's a ton of lore on unicorns too. In fact, I hear that they ride on silver moonbeams, and that they shoot rainbows out of their ass! 
Sam Winchester: Wait, there's no such thing as unicorns? 
***
Dean Winchester: [Looking at the haunted hotel] We might even run into Fred and Daphne inside. Mmmm... Daphne. Love her. 
***
Dean Winchester: Come on man. I know Sam, ok? Better than anyone. He's got more of a conscience than I do. I mean the guy feels guilty searching the internet for porn. 
***
Dean Winchester: I'm not gonna die in a hospital where the nurses aren't even hot. 
***
Dean Winchester: We know a little about a lot of things; just enough to make us dangerous. 
***
Dean Winchester: [Sam points to a word carved into a telephone pole] Croatoan? 
Sam Winchester: Yeah. 
[Dean stares blankly] 
Sam Winchester: Roanoke... lost colony... ring a bell? Dean, did you pay any attention in history class? 
Dean Winchester: Yeah. Shot heard 'round the world, how bills become laws... 
Sam Winchester: That's not school; that's schoolhouse rock! 
***
Dean Winchester: Ya' know she could be faking. 
Sam Winchester: Yeah, what do you wanna do, poke her with a stick? 
[Dean nods] 
Sam Winchester: Dude, you're not gonna poke her with a stick? 
***
Dean Winchester: Damn cops. 
Sam Winchester: They were just doing their job. 
Dean Winchester: No, they were doing our job, only they don't know it so they suck at it. 
***
Dean Winchester: [after a nice cop says okie dokie] I like him, he says okie dokie. 
***
Sam Winchester: Dude, I'm not enabling your sick habit. You're like one of those lab rats that pushes the pleasure button instead of the food button until it dies. 
Dean Winchester: What are you talking about, I eat. 
***
Dean Winchester: What's a P.A.? 
Sam Winchester: I think it's kinda like a slave. 
***
McG: Marty, what do you think? 
Martin: Not married to salt, what do you want? still sticking with condiments? 
McG: Just sounds different, not better. What else would a ghost be scared of? 
Walter Dixon: Aww, ya gotta be kidding me. 
Martin: [Aside] What would a ghost be scared of? 
[to McG] 
Martin: Maybe shotguns. 
McG: K, that makes even less sense than salt. 
***
Sam Winchester: Why'd you let me fall asleep? 
Dean Winchester: Because I am an awesome brother. What did you dream about? 
Sam Winchester: Lollipops and candycanes. 
***
Dean Winchester: This looks like a zombie pen, Sammy. 
***
Sam Winchester: Well, before we go stabbing things into Cooper, we're gonna wanna make damn sure it's him. 
Dean Winchester: You're such a stickler for details, Sammy. 
***
Bobby Singer: You Idgets! 
***
Sam Winchester: Bon Jovi? 
Dean Winchester: Bon Jovi rocks... on occasion. 
***
[repeated line] 
Bobby Singer: Balls! 
***
DEAN:  Your, ah, half-caf, double-vanilla latte is gettin' cold over here, Francis.
SAM:  Bite me.***
[Dean falls on top of Sam as they sneak through a half open window]
DEAN:  Oh, sorry!
SAM:  Be Quiet!
DEAN: You be Quiet!
SAM: You be Quiet!
***
DEAN: Have you ever actually watched daytime tv? It's terrible! ***
SAM: I think I might be allergic to our soap [Dean laughs lodly]SAM: Did you do this?![Dean laughs loudly and walks away]SAM: Your a fricken jerk!***
DEAN: Hey Sam I dare you to drink this.
SAM: Now why would I drink it?
DEAN: I double-dare you!***
MISSOUI: Boy if you put that foot on my table I'll wack you with a spoon!
DEAN: I didn't do anything!
MISSOUI: Yeah! But you were thinkin' it!***
DEAN: Hey, Sam, Who do you think is hotter - Patricia Arquet, Jennifer Love-Hewit or you?***
SAM: Dude knock it off.
DEAN: Oh your just afraid your going to get nair in your shampoo again.
SAM: Well just remember who started it.
DEAN: Yeah bring it on Baldy.***
DEAN: See that attitude right there! That is why I always got the extra cookie.***
SAM: Dude, I'm not using this fake id!
DEAN: Why not?
SAM: Coz it says nikini inspector on it!
DEAN: Don't worry they never look at it anyway.***
SAM: Jerk
DEAN: Bitch***
SAM: When I told dad I was afraid of what was in the closet he gave me a 45".
DEAN: What was he suppose to do?
SAM: I was 9yrs old! He was spose to say don't be afraid of the dark!
DEAN: Don't be afraid of the dark?! Of course you should be afraid of the dark if you know what's out there!***
DEAN: [about to be sacrificed in an orchard]I hope your apple-pie is fricken worth it.***
LYNDA: Let me just say that we accept homeowners of any race, colour or ... sexual orientation.
DEAN: Hmm, right ... I'm gonna go talk to Larry. Ok, honey [slaps Sam on the ass]***
SAM: You need to calm down.
DEAN: Well I'm sorry I can't.
SAM: Yes you can.
DEAN: Sam, this plane is gonna crash so stop treating me like I'm fricken four!
SAM: You need to relax.
DEAN: Stop with the touchy self-help yoga crap! It's not Helpin'!
***
POLICEMAN: Boy, you are officially a suspect.
DEAN: Yeah because that makes a lot of sense seeing as though the first one was in 82 when I was 3!
***
EMILY: So what's the plan?
DEAN: I'm thinking about it.
[a little while later when it's dark]EMILY: You don't have a plan, do you?
DEAN: I'm thinking about it.
***
DEAN: Your not gonna try and kill me, are you?
SAM: No.
DEAN: Good. Coz then that would just be knida awkward.
***
DEAN: Keep an eye on the scarecrow coz we don't know when it'll come alive.
SAM:  ... What scarecrow?
***
SAM: Admit it amn. You gotta update your cassette collection.
DEAN: Why?
SAM: Well for one there cassettes and two Black Sabboth,Motorhead and Metallica. It's the greatest piece of mullet rock.
DEAN: You know what?House rules, Sammy. Driver picks music. Shotgun shuts his cakehole.
***
ANDREA: There it is. Two blocks like I said.
DEAN: Thanks.
ANDREA: Must be hard with your sense of direction, rather than being able to find your way to a decent pick up line.
