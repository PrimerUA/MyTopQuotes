Piper: I just wish I could get a live guy. 
***
Phoebe: I forgot your question. 
Piper: I asked if Prue was going to have sex with someone other than herself this year. 
Phoebe: That's disgusting. Please say yes. 
***
Andy: Everything happens for a reason, remember, you told me that, Prue. 
***
Phoebe: Go away horny tom cats. 
***
Phoebe: Come on, you don't think we'll be 60 and still living together, sharing clothes and a cat. 
Piper: Well now that you put it that way, no, I don't want to live with you anymore.
***
Piper: Yeah. Sure, why not? We could have another funeral tomorrow. I mean, all the dishes are out and we pretty much know who to invite. 
***
Piper: So why is Sir Lust-A-Lot after you? 
Paige: How should I know? 
Piper: Well, because it's your damn fairy tale and it's alive and frozen in our kitchen. 
***
Piper: You know, if I could freeze the two of you, I would, often. 
***
Leo: Piper, this is completely illegal. 
Piper: Yeah? Well, so is marrying a dead guy, okay? 
[She holds up his death certificate] 
Piper: Let's not get technical now. 
***
Piper: Darryl, I'm sorry, but what do you want me to say? My sister was just possessed with a supernaturally born killer and my husband is in 1994, and I do not mean in the fashion sense. He time traveled back with my other sister so the only one left to help me is you. 
***
Piper: I'm not pregnant. Trust me. 
Prue: Well, that's good news. 
Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's great news. You can live. 
***
Prue: I mean, well, you are a warlock magnet. 
***
Darryl: Piper... 
Piper: Uh-huh. 
Darryl: You froze the crime scene. 
Piper: Uh-huh. 
Darryl: You cannot freeze a crime scene. 
Piper: Well, I did. 
***
Piper: Tell me the truth. Do you think I'm pushing it too far with the wedding? 
Prue: Okay, why is Phoebe going to school without her books? 
Piper: Okay, why is Prue not answering Piper's question? 
***
Darryl: Oh, no creepy talk in the precinct. Will you just keep down the creepy talk. 
***
Piper: Don't act blonde. 
***
Piper: Leo, you're a nice guy, and I like you a lot, but let's face it, you're geographically undesirable. 
***
Prue: Great, so some guy couldn't keep it in his sheath and now I'm marked for death. 
Piper: Well, some men can be very sensitive about their weapons. 
***
Phoebe: I'll do what I should've done a while ago which is vanquish your sorry ass. 
***
Phoebe: I hope this doesn't mean we get our *virginity* back too. 
***
Leo: Piper, he's gonna kill me when he finds out. 
Piper: Don't be ridiculous, you're already dead. 
***
Phoebe: *Hey*! Don't call me sweetie! You can't imprison someone and then call them sweetie! 
***
Paige: Well, you wanted to live like us. Now you get to die like us. 
***
Lazarus Demon: Go to hell! 
Piper: I'm already there! 
***
Phoebe: Where the hell is Leo, it's been five hours and he hasn't responded to any of my calls. 
Chris Perry: I really don't know 
Piper: Well I really think you do know 
Chris Perry: Well maybe I do, and if I'm right, Leo's gonna need some major alone time 
Piper: You know what? Cut the cryptic crap. I want you to go up there and bring Leo back now. 
Chris Perry: Fine. But if I was you I would focus on finding a way to unfreeze Paige 'cause you're gonna need her... soon 
Piper: I swear to God if he does not bring Leo back I am gonna blow his ass back to the future orbs and all. 
Phoebe: Okay, Piper maybe it would be better if you go downstairs and spend some time with Wyatt... you're not breathing are you? 
Piper: Nope 
Phoebe: Breathe, inhale, exhale, okay next sister. 
***
Leo Wyatt: Look, Piper, no matter what happens... 
Piper: No... 
Leo Wyatt: You have to keep trying to make contact. 
Piper: I don't want him to hear it... 
Leo Wyatt: He's not after you, he's after me. 
Piper: Would you please stop trying to save me! 
Leo Wyatt: I'm sorry I got you into this. 
Piper: [crying] Yeah, just one ordeal after another, right? 
Leo Wyatt: I've never stopped loving you. 
[her eyes welling up with tears, Piper's resistance finally melts and she leans in to kiss Leo] 
***
Paige: Power. Power's good. I like power. Why do I like power? 
***
Cole: Phoebe, I love you. I don't know what's going on but maybe I can help. Would you like me to kill someone for you? 
***
Barbas: How cute. The great big elder's afraid of the teeny-weeny itsy-witsy baby. 
***
Phoebe: No time to dawdle, there's a baby on the way. 
Leo: This is crazy. You can't leave like this. 
Paige: We, very well can't ignore Chris's birth now can we? 
Chris: I'm the baby. I give you permission to. 
***
Paige: [walks in on Phoebe standing naked, standing up in the bathtub] Whoa... full frontal Phoebe! 
Cole: She flashed. 
Paige: Yeah... I - I got that. 
Cole: No, I mean she flashed black-and-white. 
***
[Wyatt has shrunken Piper and Leo into a doll house size of the Manor] 
Piper: OK... let me handle Wyatt. This requires a mother's touch... Wyatt Matthew Halliwell! You stop this nonsense right now! 
***
Piper: Phoebe, how many times have I told you not to play dress-up with the demons? 
***
Leo: Phoebe, you cant be the Queen of the Underworld and a charmed one! 
***
Piper: I dreamt an animated musical last night. Is that normal? 
***
Piper: I didn't need a sign to tell me where my heart lies. 
[smiles at Leo] 
***
Phoebe: 28 minutes, 33 seconds. 
[Piper looks at her] 
Piper: Really? We ran that long? 
Phoebe: No, that's how long you've been comparing Leo and Dan. 
Piper: I haven't been comparing - I've just been... talking. 
Phoebe: Non-stop. 
***
Leo Wyatt: Now that I'm a mortal, I'm going to fight for you and let the best man win. 
***
Paige: Is there something that we don't know... that we should know... you know? 
***
Piper: You don't really seem like yourself. 
Paige: I don't? Then, who am I? 
***
Phoebe: Piper. 
Piper: Don't you "Piper" me. 
***
Head Dwarf: When's her prince getting here? 
Piper: She doesn't have a prince. 
Head Dwarf: No prince? So then who's going to kiss her? 
Stinky: I'll do it. 
Dwarf: In your dreams stinky. I'll do it. 
Stinky: I told you not to call me that. 
Head Dwarf: People. A little professional decorum here please. 
[to Piper] 
Head Dwarf: Forgive them, it's been a while. 
***
Paige: So how exactly do I bless this thing? 
Phoebe: With your blood. Come on. 
[takes Paige into the dining room and holds up a needle] 
Phoebe: This'll just hurt a little. 
***
Piper: Oh, you know what? She's getting angry. And our powers don't work so good when we're angry. 
Mitzy Stillman: We've got them now. 
Piper: Yeah, you've got us now so why don't you blow us up? 
Phoebe: Piper, death bad, life good. 
Paige: Don't worry, this bimbo couldn't hit the broadside of a beauty parlour. Check out that dye job. 
[the blonde sisters gasp] 
Mabel Stillman: How dare you! 
[Mabel blows up the doors] 
Piper: Run! 
***
Witch Doctor: You sure these are good witches that live here? 
Leo: The best. Although one of them is going to go very evil on us if we don't get this room cleaned up in a hurry. Believe me. 
Witch Doctor: Is that a fact? 
Leo: Well, not literally. 
***
Phoebe: [singing] Oh, I'm making soup for Cole, he'll eat it in a bowl, I guess that's my new role, making soup for Cole. 
***
Darryl: Okay, where is this baby that everybody keeps talking about? Is it an invisible baby? Am I gonna step on it? 
***
Cole: You've got to hold my hand. 
Prue: This already sucks. 
***
Prue: Innocents and alleys, don't they ever learn? 
***
Prue: Oh, I think someone needs a time out little missy. 
***
Piper: It was all of those women showing off their sonogram pictures, and it was just working on my last nerve. Like, "Look, it's Jasper's first photo. And it's going to go on the fridge in a magnetic frame that says 'Jasper's First Photo'." 
Leo: Okay, I thought prenatal yoga was supposed to help you relax. 
***
Prue: Are you a good witch or a bad witch? 
Piper: I'm going to be a very good witch from now on. 
***
Phoebe: You have really got to lay off the rhyming, Prue 
***
Cole: Why would I ever not want to talk to you? 
Phoebe: I don't know, you know, just in case you thought I was a drunk or a lunatic, or a drunk lunatic. 
***
Prue: I hate to be the detail police. 
***
Leo: I hate to be a bearer of bad news. 
Piper: Could you possibly be the bearer of a big hug? 
***
Phoebe: Wanna take a wiccan time out and do the crossword puzzle? 
***
Phoebe: I curse you, you curse me, let's get together and do a little cursing. 
***
Phoebe: Anyone got a vanquish in their pocket 
***
Phoebe: We could sure use some cosmic help right about now. 
***
Paige: I like an element of danger. 
***
Paige: You used to be a demon *and* a lawyer? 
Cole: Yeah. 
Paige: Insert joke here. 
***
Phoebe: I think I found the demon. Oh my god... 
Paige: What? You can't say "demons" followed by "oh my god" - I'm new at this, I'm likely to panic. 
***
Demon Of Illusion: Silly Witches. Tricks Are For Kids. 
***
Phoebe: Got milk? Oooh, don't think so. 
***
Piper: I'll play the bitch, you play the witch, ok? 
***
Piper: I'm gonna be happy when I vanquish your sorry ass. 
***
