Tyrion: I'm a monster, as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
***
Tyrion: Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
***
Robb: My father is dead. And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless.
***
Sandor (The Hound): Any man dies with a clean sword, I'll rape his fu-king corpse!
***
Cersei: The gods have no mercy, that's why they're gods.
***
Varys: I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting.
Tyrion: I'm entirely sure, you're entirely sure, what I'm suggesting.
***
Varys: I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror, a dead king, a city under siege.
Tyrion: A wedding.
 Varys: Exactly.
***
Tyrion: Those are brave men knocking at our door. Let's go kill them!
***
Cersei: Tears aren't a woman's only weapon. The best one's between your legs.
***
Tyrion: I much like my head. I don't want to see it removed just yet.
***	
Bronn: Do you know how to use that?
Tyrion: I chopped wood once. No, actually, I watched my brother chop wood.
***
Tyrion: The Lord of Light wants his enemies burnt. The Drowned God wants his enemies drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious c-nts? Where is the god of t-ts and wine?
***
Jaime Lannister: Has anyone ever told you you're as boring as you are ugly?
***
Tyrion: You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality; that and your cheekbones.
***
Robb Stark: I asked him, How can a man be brave if he's afraid? That is the only time a man can be brave, he told me.
***
Jaime: Three victories don't make you a conquerer.
Robb: It's better than three defeats.
***
Catelyn: There's a king in ever corner now
***
Tyrion: I'm the captain. If this ship goes down, I go down with it.
Varys: I'm sure many captains said the same when the ship was afloat.
***
Eddard Stark: Winter is coming... 
***
Jaime Lannister: Robert will choose a new hand of the kingdom to do his job while he's out fucking boars or hunting whores... or is it the other way around? 
***
Magister Illyrio Mopatis: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality. 
***
Magister Illyrio Mopatis: A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair. 
***
Viserys Targaryen: So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? 
Daenerys Targaryen: I don't know. 
Viserys Targaryen: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you - all 40,000 men and their horses too if that's what it took. 
***
Daenerys Targaryen: I don't want to be his Queen. I want to go home. 
Viserys Targaryen: So do I. I want us both to go home, but, they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home? 
Daenerys Targaryen: I don't know. 
Viserys Targaryen: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo's army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you - all forty thousand men - and their horses too if that's what it took.

[last lines] 
Jaime Lannister: The things I do for love... 
[Jaime pushes Bran from the window] 
***
Tyrion Lannister: Let me tell you something, Bastard. Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you. 
Jon Snow: What the hell do you know about being a bastard? 
Tyrion Lannister: All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes. 
***
Eddard Stark: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. 
***
Catelyn Stark: He won't be a boy forever. And, winter is coming. 
***
Eddard Stark: Winter is coming.

Waymar Royce: [after discovering a massacred wildling village] What do you expect? They're savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot, and before you now it, they're ripping each other to pieces. 
Will: I never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life! 
Waymar Royce: How close did you get? 
Will: Close as any man would. 
Gared: We should head back to the Wall. 
Waymar Royce: Do the dead frighten you? 
Gared: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked 'em. They won't trouble us no more. 
Waymar Royce: You don't think he'll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse. 
[Gared looks at Will and turns away, grumbling] 
Will: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children. 
Waymar Royce: It's a good thing we're not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter... if I don't catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won't say it again. 
***
Ser Rodrik Cassel: [Ned and Catelyn are watching the boys at archery practice when Ser Rodrik walks up] Lord Stark... milady. The guardsmen just rode in from the hills. They've captured a deserter from the Night's Watch. 
Eddard Stark: [pause] Get the lads to saddle their horses. 
Catelyn Stark: Do you have to? 
Eddard Stark: He swore an oath, Cat. 
Ser Rodrik Cassel: Law is law, milady. 
Eddard Stark: Tell Bran he's coming, too. 
[Ser Rodrik nods and walks away] 
Catelyn Stark: Ned... ten is too young to see such things. 
Eddard Stark: He won't be a boy forever... and winter is coming. 
***
Will: [to Ned, just before his execution] I know I broke my oath. I know I'm a deserter. I should've gone back to the Wall and warned them, but... I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family... tell 'em I'm no coward. Tell 'em I'm sorry. 
[Ned pauses, then nods. The guards force Will onto the chopping block and Ned draws his sword] 
Will: Forgive me, lord. 
Eddard Stark: In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of His Name... 
Jon Snow: [aside, to Bran] Don't look away. Father will know if you do. 
Eddard Stark: ...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm, I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die. 
[he decaptitates Will] 
Jon Snow: [to Bran] You did well. 
***
Eddard Stark: [after Will's execution] You understand why I did it? 
Bran Stark: Jon said he was a deserter. 
Eddard Stark: But do you understand why I had to kill him? 
Bran Stark: Our way is the old way? 
Eddard Stark: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword. 
Bran Stark: Is it true he saw the White Walkers? 
Eddard Stark: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years. 
Bran Stark: So he was lying. 
Eddard Stark: A madman sees what he sees. 
***
Catelyn Stark: [Ned is cleaning his sword in Winterfell's godswood after Will's execution] All these years, and I still feel like an outsider when I come here. 
Eddard Stark: You have five northern children. You're not an outsider. 
Catelyn Stark: I wonder if the old gods agree. 
Eddard Stark: It's your gods, by all the rules. 
Catelyn Stark: [pause, then Catelyn produces a parchment from her sleeve] I am so sorry, my love. 
Eddard Stark: Tell me. 
Catelyn Stark: There was a raven from King's Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. 
[Ned slowly looks away in shock] 
Catelyn Stark: I know he was like a father to you. 
Eddard Stark: Your sister, the boy... 
Catelyn Stark: They both have their health, gods be good. 
[Catelyn sits down next to Ned] 
Catelyn Stark: The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell... with the queen, and all the rest of them. 
Eddard Stark: If he's coming this far north... there's only one thing he's after. 
Catelyn Stark: You can always say no, Ned. 
***
Catelyn Stark: We'll need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrion's chamber. I'm told he reads all night. 
Maester Luwin: I'm told he drinks all night. 
Catelyn Stark: How much could he possibly drink, a man of his... stature? 
Maester Luwin: We've brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar. Perhaps we'll find out. 
Catelyn Stark: In any case, candles.
